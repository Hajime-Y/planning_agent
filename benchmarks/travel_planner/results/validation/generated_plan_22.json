If this is not possible, alternative stays with minimum nights of 2-3 could be considered, but this would reflect in estimated cost. Adjustments can be made for a more budget fit as needed, such as selecting an alternative Moline accommodation for some nights. If cost needs to be reduced to fit strict $1,900 budget, one could select Private Room in Cozy shared apt in Williamsburg ($527/night) for Moline, total $527 x 3 = $1,581, giving: $164 + $1,581 + $210 + $250 = $2,205 (still slightly over). Consider staying only 2 nights in Moline, 2 in Rockford for truer $1,900 fit if needed. \n\nAll attractions, restaurants, and accommodations selected from the provided data and fit within logistical and commonsense constraints.", "gpt-4.1_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"days": 1, "current_city": "from Colorado Springs to Moline", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Colorado Springs to Moline, Departure Time: 06:00, Arrival Time: 18:49, Cost: 73", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Cafe Illuminatii, Moline", "accommodation": "Sunny duplex near Central Park, Moline"}, {"days": 2, "current_city": "Moline", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Zoe, Moline", "attraction": "John Deere Pavilion, Moline;Ben Butterworth Parkway, Moline;", "lunch": "Royal Hotel, Moline", "dinner": "Arabian Knights, Moline", "accommodation": "Sunny duplex near Central Park, Moline"}, {"days": 3, "current_city": "Moline", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Lovecrumbs Bakery, Moline", "attraction": "Celebration River Cruises, Moline;Prospect Park, Moline;", "lunch": "ZASTY, Moline", "dinner": "Mummy's Kitchen, Moline", "accommodation": "Sunny duplex near Central Park, Moline"}, {"days": 4, "current_city": "from Moline to Rockford", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Moline to Rockford, Departure Time: 08:00, Arrival Time: 10:01, Cost: 9", "breakfast": "Hucka, Moline", "attraction": "Burpee Museum of Natural History, Rockford;Anderson Japanese Gardens, Rockford;", "lunch": "Flying Mango, Rockford", "dinner": "Coco Bambu, Rockford", "accommodation": "Private Room in a two bedroom apt., Rockford"}, {"days": 5, "current_city": "from Rockford to Colorado Springs", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Rockford to Colorado Springs, Departure Time: 07:00, Arrival Time: 21:38, Cost: 82", "breakfast": "Subway, Rockford", "attraction": "Nicholas Conservatory & Gardens, Rockford;", "lunch": "Cafe Southall, Rockford", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
