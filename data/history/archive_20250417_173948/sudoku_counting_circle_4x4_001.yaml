title: Solve 4x4 Counting Circles Sudoku
description: 'Solve the provided 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with the counting circles rule.
  Starting grid: . 4 2 . / . 2 . . / . 1 3 . / . . 1 .  Circles at positions: r1c1,
  r1c2, r2c2, r2c3, r2c4, r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c4. Counting Circle Rule: Any digit
  in a circle indicates exactly how many circles contain that digit.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules apply: each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits
  1-4 once each.'
- 'Given initial values: . 4 2 . / . 2 . . / . 1 3 . / . . 1 .'
- 'Circles are marked at: r1c1, r1c2, r2c2, r2c3, r2c4, r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c4.'
- 'Counting Circle rule: if a circle contains digit X, then exactly X of the circles
  (including itself) must contain digit X.'
- The solution should respect both Sudoku and counting circle constraints.
