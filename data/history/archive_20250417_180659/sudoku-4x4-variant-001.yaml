title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku Variant with Sum Clues (X=10, V=5) and Logical Placement
description: 'Solve the 4x4 sudoku variant puzzle as described. Apply all given constraints,
  including:

  - sum clues (X = 10, V = 5) between cells,

  - uniqueness of digits in each row and column,

  - normal sudoku box/row/column sums as per 4x4 standard rules,

  - only place a digit when it is logically forced by constraints.'
constraints:
- Each row contains all digits 1-4 exactly once.
- Each column contains all digits 1-4 exactly once.
- Each 2x2 box contains all digits 1-4 exactly once.
- An X clue between two cells means their digits sum to 10.
- A V clue between two cells means their digits sum to 5.
- Only place a digit if it is uniquely determined (logically forced) by current state
  and constraints.
- No guessing allowed; every step must be logically deducible.
- All given constraints must be maintained after every placement.
resources:
- Initial puzzle grid (empty except for clues and/or some digits)
- Sum clue positions and their values (X=10, V=5) between specific cells
- Knowledge of 4x4 sudoku standard rules
