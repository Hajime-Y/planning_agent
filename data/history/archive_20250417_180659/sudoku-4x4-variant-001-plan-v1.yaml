subtasks:
- id: parse_initial_puzzle
  description: 'Initialize the puzzle grid: parse starting clues (given digits), and
    set up locations/values of X and V clues between cells.'
  status: not_started
  order: 1
  inputs:
  - Raw initial puzzle grid (digits and/or blank cells)
  - List of X/V clue locations (cell pairs and their sum clue type)
  outputs:
  - Structured puzzle representation, including grid and clue mapping
- id: deduce_forced_placements
  description: Iteratively scan the puzzle and apply sudoku and sum constraints to
    deduce cells where only one digit can fit.
  status: not_started
  order: 2
  inputs:
  - Structured puzzle representation (grid and clue mapping)
  outputs:
  - List of forced placements (cell, digit) and updated puzzle state
- id: apply_placement_and_update
  description: Update the puzzle grid by placing each logically-forced digit and propagate
    constraints (rows, columns, boxes, sum clues).
  status: not_started
  order: 3
  inputs:
  - Current puzzle state
  - List of forced placements
  outputs:
  - Updated puzzle state after placements
- id: repeat_until_complete
  description: Repeat deduction and placement, step by step, until all cells are filled
    or no further logical placements possible.
  status: not_started
  order: 4
  inputs:
  - Current puzzle state
  outputs:
  - Sequence of placement steps; final solved state or halt at impasse
- id: verify_and_output_solution
  description: Verify final filled grid satisfies all sudoku and sum clues. Output
    solution if valid.
  status: not_started
  order: 5
  inputs:
  - Final filled puzzle grid
  outputs:
  - Verified solution grid (or explanation if unsolvable)
