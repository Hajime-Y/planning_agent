title: 4x4 Sudoku Solver with Special Constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku with the following conditions:

  - Normal Sudoku rules (place numbers 1-4 once in each row, column, and 2x2 box)

  - Digits an equal distance from the center of a gray ''Zipper Line'' must sum to
  the digit in the center of that line

  - Circle clues: digit in a circle shows how many circles that digit appears in

  - Board and clues are:

  [[. 4 1 2], [. 1 . 3], [1 2 3 4], [. 3 2 .]]

  - Circles at: r1c1, r2c1, r3c1, r4c2, r4c3, r2c4

  - Zipper line: r1c1-r2c1-r3c1-r4c1-r4c2-r4c3-r4c4 and r2c2-r2c3-r3c3'
constraints:
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain the digits 1-4 exactly once
- Digits an equal distance from the center of a gray 'Zipper Line' must sum to the
  digit in the center position
- A digit inside a circle indicates how many circles that digit appears in (total
  in all circles)
- 'Given Sudoku board: first row: . 4 1 2; second row: . 1 . 3; third: 1 2 3 4; fourth:
  . 3 2 .'
- 'Circles are at cells: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,2), (4,3), (2,4) (1-indexed)'
- 'Zipper line path is: (1,1)-(2,1)-(3,1)-(4,1)-(4,2)-(4,3)-(4,4) (+ subline (2,2)-(2,3)-(3,3))'
resources:
- Sudoku grid with initial clues
- Circle locations
- Zipper line positions
