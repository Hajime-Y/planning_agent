title: 4x4 Counting Circle Sudoku Solver Plan
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle where, in addition to standard sudoku rules,
  certain cells with white circles impose a counting constraint: each digit in a circled
  cell indicates how many times that digit appears in all circled cells. The provided
  clues and circle locations must be correctly accounted for.'
constraints:
- Each row, column, and 2x2 block contains the digits 1-4 with no repeats.
- Certain cells contain a white circle; in each, if a digit X is placed, then exactly
  X circled cells in the grid must contain the digit X.
- 'The initial clues are: r1c2=4, r1c3=2, r2c2=2, r3c2=1, r3c3=3, r4c3=1.'
- 'The following cells have white circles: r1c1, r1c2, r2c2, r2c3, r2c4, r3c1, r4c1,
  r4c2, r4c4.'
- Each cell must be filled so both standard sudoku rules and the circle counting constraint
  are satisfied.
- The solution should be unique and fully fill the grid.
resources:
- Provided initial clues
- White circle cell positions
- Standard sudoku rules
- Circle counting rules as described
