title: Solve 4x4 Error Sudoku with Row/Column Sums and Palindrome
description: 'Solve the 4x4 Error Sudoku puzzle using digits 1–4, with the following
  constraints:

  - Each digit 1–4 appears exactly 4 times on the board

  - For each digit N, there must be exactly N errors (cells where N violates standard
  Sudoku rules)

  - Row and column sums are given as clues around the board

  - There are palindrome lines as specified (their cells must form palindromes)

  - Regions are specified (each region must contain digits 1–4 exactly once)

  - The grid is 4x4.'
constraints:
- The puzzle grid is 4x4.
- Digits 1–4 are used.
- Each digit D (1–4) appears exactly 4 times on the grid.
- 'For every digit N, exactly N errors occur: N is used in N cells where at least
  one standard Sudoku rule would be violated for that N.'
- Row and column sums are given as clues, matching the sum of the digits in that row
  or column.
- There are palindrome lines (specified per puzzle); digits along these lines must
  read the same forward and backward.
- Defined regions; each region must have digits 1–4 exactly once.
- Standard Sudoku rules are generally followed except for the error cells as required.
