- id: parse_input_grid_and_constraints
  description: Receive and parse the 4x4 sudoku puzzle grid, black dot locations (with
    ratio rule), and all colored line rules/positions into a structured internal representation.
  status: not_started
  order: 1
  inputs:
  - Sudoku grid (possibly partially filled)
  - Black dot position(s)
  - Colored line positions and their rule details
  outputs:
  - Structured sudoku puzzle state with all constraints
- id: generate_candidate_lists
  description: For each empty cell, determine all candidate digits allowed by sudoku
    and provided constraints.
  status: not_started
  order: 2
  inputs:
  - Structured sudoku puzzle state with all constraints
  outputs:
  - Candidate digits list for each cell
- id: deduce_forced_moves
  description: Identify all cells where a single digit is logically forced by current
    constraints (including black dot and colored line rules).
  status: not_started
  order: 3
  inputs:
  - Candidate digits list for each cell
  outputs:
  - List of cells and their forced digit (if any)
- id: place_forced_digits_and_update_state
  description: Place forced digits into the grid and update the puzzle state; remove
    placed digits from relevant candidate lists.
  status: not_started
  order: 4
  inputs:
  - Current sudoku puzzle state
  - List of forced digit placements
  outputs:
  - Updated sudoku puzzle state
  - Updated candidate lists
- id: check_completion_or_repeat
  description: If the puzzle is not yet complete and more forced moves can be made,
    repeat deduction and placement steps until solved or no progress is possible.
  status: not_started
  order: 5
  inputs:
  - Updated sudoku puzzle state
  - Updated candidate lists
  outputs:
  - Final solved grid OR notification that the puzzle cannot be solved logically with
    current information
