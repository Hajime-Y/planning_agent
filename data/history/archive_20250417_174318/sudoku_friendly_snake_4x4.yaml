title: 4x4 Sudoku with 'friendly' snake constraint
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with additional ''friendly snake'' rules:
  Each digit 1-4 appears once per row, column, and 2x2 box. A cell is ''friendly''
  if its digit equals its row, column, or box number; all and only non-friendly cells
  must form a single snake. The snake starts at r1c1, is 1-cell wide and orthogonally
  connected, cannot branch or touch itself, must visit each 2x2 box at least once,
  and contains no friendly cells. Initial board is empty. The first move must be a
  logically forced digit placement based on constraints.'
constraints:
- 'Sudoku standard: In each row, column, and 2x2 box, digits 1-4 must appear exactly
  once.'
- '''Friendly'' cell: its digit matches its row, column, or box number (rows/cols/boxes
  labeled 1-4)'
- The 'snake' comprises ALL and ONLY non-friendly cells.
- Snake must start at cell r1c1.
- Snake is orthogonally connected (no diagonal).
- Snake is 1-cell wide, does not branch, loop, or touch itself.
- Snake must visit (cover at least 1 cell in) each 2x2 box.
- No non-snake, non-friendly cells exist.
- 'First move: Place a digit in a cell that is logically forced by uniqueness, Sudoku,
  or snake/friendly rules.'
