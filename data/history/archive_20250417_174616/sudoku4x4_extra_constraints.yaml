title: Solve the 4x4 Sudoku with Extra Constraints and Visual Elements
description: 'Given a 4x4 sudoku puzzle with the following constraints:

  - Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the same 4-digit subset from 1-9.

  - Visual elements: thermometers (increasing numbers from bulb to tip), black/white
  dots (consecutive or 1-difference), gray square (even number required).

  - Givens: r1c2=4, r1c3=5, r2c2=5, r3c2=8, r3c3=6, r4c3=8.'
constraints:
- The puzzle is a 4x4 sudoku grid.
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the same 4 distinct digits, subset of digits
  from 1-9 (no repeats within each row/column/box).
- 'Thermometer segments: digits increase from bulb to tip.'
- Between connected cells with a white dot there must be a 1-difference (consecutive
  digits).
- Between connected cells with a black dot, digits must be in a 2:1 ratio.
- Gray square must contain an even number.
- 'Initial values: r1c2=4, r1c3=5, r2c2=5, r3c2=8, r3c3=6, r4c3=8.'
- All extra constraints based on given visual elements (thermometers, dots, gray square)
  must be enforced.
resources:
- Blank 4x4 sudoku grid.
- List of given visual elements (thermometers, black/white dots, gray square).
- 'Digit subset (implicit: four digits out of 1-9, to be deduced as part of the solve).'
- Given cell values.
