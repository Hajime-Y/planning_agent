title: '4x4 Euler Sudoku with Thermometers and Colors: First Placement Deduction'
description: Solve a 4x4 Euler Sudoku using digits 1-4 and four colors, with each
  digit/color combination appearing exactly once. Each row, column, and box must have
  all digits and all colors. 3 thermometers (r1c2→r2c3, r2c2→r3c3), gray circles (odd
  digit) in r1c2, r2c2, r3c4. Deduce the first certain placement and provide it with
  reason.
constraints:
- 4x4 Sudoku grid; fill each cell with one digit (1-4) and one color (out of 4).
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain every digit exactly once.
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain each color exactly once.
- Every digit/color combination must appear exactly once in the grid (i.e., (digit,color)
  uniqueness).
- 'Three thermometers: Thermo1 r1c2→r2c3, Thermo2 r2c2→r3c3. On each thermometer,
  digits strictly increase from bulb to tip.'
- 'Gray circles in r1c2, r2c2, r3c4: these cells must have odd digits (1 or 3).'
- First certain placement to be deduced must include cell, digit, color, and logical
  justification.
resources:
- Sudoku solving knowledge (row/col/box rules)
- Euler Sudoku digit/color pairing constraint
- Thermometer Sudoku logic
- Given odd cells as gray circle constraint
