title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with V/X/Killer constraints
description: "Solve the provided 4x4 Sudoku grid with special constraints:\n- Fill\
  \ grid with digits 1-9, no repeats per row, column, box.\n- Each row, column, and\
  \ box must have a unique set of digits.\n- The sum of the digits in each row/column/box\
  \ is unknown value x (to be found).\n- Digits separated by a V must sum to 5, those\
  \ separated by an X sum to 10. Not all X/V are shown.\n- Provided grid layout and\
  \ placements:\n    . 1 5 .\n    . 7 . .\n    . 4 2 .\n    . . 8 .\n    Visual clues:\
  \ V between r1c1 & r1c2, V between r2c3 & r3c3, X between r2c2 & r2c3, X between\
  \ r1c4 & r2c4, X between r3c2 & r4c2.\n"
constraints:
- Fill each cell with a digit 1-9.
- No digit repeats in any row, column, or 2x2 box.
- Each row, column, and box must have a unique set of digits.
- The sum x of each row, column, and box is unknown and to be determined as part of
  the solution.
- If a V is given between two cells, those cells must sum to 5.
- If an X is given between two cells, those cells must sum to 10.
- Not all X or V clues are shown.
- Given grid values and clues must be strictly followed.
