title: Solve a 4x4 Euler Sudoku puzzle with digits, colors, thermometers, and an odd
  circle
description: Solve a 4x4 Euler Sudoku variant where each cell contains a digit (1-4)
  and a color (4 colors), and every digit/color combination appears exactly once in
  the grid. Thermometers and a gray circle (that must contain an odd digit) provide
  extra placement constraints. The puzzle starts empty.
constraints:
- The grid is 4x4, cells must be filled with digits 1-4.
- Each cell is also assigned one of 4 colors (identifiers to be determined).
- Every digit-color pair appears exactly once in the whole grid.
- 'Standard Sudoku constraints: each digit appears only once per row and column.'
- 'Standard Sudoku constraints: each color appears only once per row and column.'
- Thermometers (not specified in detail) add sequential placement constraints (lower
  to higher digits along thermometer).
- There is a gray circle cell which must have an odd digit (1 or 3).
- The grid is initially empty.
- 'Stepwise logical solving process required: Analyze constraints, find forced placements,
  make and output first certain move.'
resources:
- Puzzle grid definition (4x4 cells)
- Thermometer and gray circle positions/rules (to be specified by inputs or puzzle
  image)
- Digit values (1-4)
- Color set (abstract; real colors not specified)
