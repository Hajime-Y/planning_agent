title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku Variant with Special Rules
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku variant puzzle which includes the following:

  - Standard Sudoku constraints for a 4x4 grid.

  - Subset (region) clues: certain regions may have additional restrictions.

  - Thermometer clues: specific cell sequences where digits must strictly increase
  from bulb to tip.

  - Dot clues: cells connected with a white or black dot indicating a 1-difference
  or 2-difference relation.

  - Even constraint in r2c1 (cell at row 2, column 1 must be even).

  - Initial grid: . 4 5 6 | . 5 . 8 | 4 8 6 5 | . 6 8 . (read left-to-right, row by
  row).Cells marked ''.'' are unsolved.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rule: Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1â€“4 without
  repetition.'
- There are subset (region) clues with extra restrictions (details required).
- Thermometer clues define cell sequences; digits must strictly increase from bulb
  to end.
- Dot clues indicate consecutive or 2-apart digits between connected cells.
- Cell r2c1 (second row, first column) must contain an even digit.
- 'Initial grid values are given: row 1 [. 4 5 6], row 2 [. 5 . 8], row 3 [4 8 6 5],
  row 4 [. 6 8 .].'
- All variant constraints must be considered in solution.
resources:
- Initial grid (numerical values for 4x4 cells, '.' for empty).
- Definition of subset, thermometer, dot clues (specifics may be required from puzzle
  diagram).
- Standard Sudoku solving techniques.
- Description of all special constraints.
