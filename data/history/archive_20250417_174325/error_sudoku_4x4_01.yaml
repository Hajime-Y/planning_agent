title: Error Sudoku Puzzle Solver
description: "Solve a 4x4 Error Sudoku puzzle with given constraints:\n- Fill the\
  \ grid with digits 1-4.\n- Each digit 1-4 appears exactly 4 times in the grid.\n\
  - For each digit N, exactly N errors must occur (errors = violations of standard\
  \ sudoku row/col/box rules for N).\n- Standard 2x2 box regions.\n- Row and column\
  \ sum clues:\n    - c1 (column 1): sum < 13 (top clue)\n    - c2: sum < 7 (top clue)\n\
  \    - r2 (row 2): sum > 10 (left clue)\n    - r4: sum > 10 (left clue)\n- Palindrome\
  \ constraint: the two-cell lightgray line is a palindrome (the two cells read the\
  \ same forward/backward).\n"
constraints:
- The grid is 4x4, to be filled with digits 1–4.
- Each digit 1–4 appears exactly 4 times total.
- For each digit N, exactly N errors (violations of sudoku rules) must occur for N
  in the final grid.
- Regions are 2x2 standard sudoku boxes.
- Column 1 sum < 13 (using top clue).
- Column 2 sum < 7 (using top clue).
- Row 2 sum > 10 (using left clue).
- Row 4 sum > 10 (using left clue).
- A two-cell palindrome constraint applies to the specified line (the cells must read
  the same forwards and backwards).
