title: '4x4 Sudoku Variant with Extra Constraints: Logical Deduction'
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku variant where each row, column, and 2x2 box contains
  the same 4-digit subset from 1-9. Constraints: Thermometer lines (values strictly
  increase from bulb end), black dots (adjacent cells'' values must have a 2:1 ratio),
  white dots (adjacent cells'' values must be consecutive), a gray square at r2c1
  (must be even). No initial values are provided. The goal is to logically deduce
  and commit a value to at least one cell that is fully determined by these constraints.'
constraints:
- Each row contains the same 4-digit subset from 1-9, no repeats in a row.
- Each column contains the same 4-digit subset from 1-9, no repeats in a column.
- Each 2x2 box contains the same 4-digit subset from 1-9, no repeats in a box.
- 'Thermometer lines: Values increase strictly from bulb end to tip along marked lines.'
- 'Black dot between two cells: The numbers in these cells must have a 2:1 ratio (either
  direction).'
- 'White dot between two cells: The numbers in these cells must be consecutive (difference
  of 1).'
- 'Gray square at r2c1: The value must be even.'
- All cells are initially empty.
- 'Goal: Deduce and commit a value to at least one cell by logic alone (no guesses).'
resources:
- Empty 4x4 Sudoku grid.
- Full list of 4-digit subsets from digits 1-9.
- Descriptions or locations of thermometer, black dot, white dot, and gray square
  constraints.
