title: 4x4 Region Sum Line Sudoku Solver
description: 'Solve the provided 4x4 sudoku puzzle with normal sudoku rules and the
  Region Sum Line rule:

  There are three blue lines drawn on the grid. For each blue line, the sum of the
  digits along the line is the same within each 2x2 box it passes through (call this
  value N for each box). The initial grid is:

  Row 1: . 3 1 .

  Row 2: . 1 . .

  Row 3: . 4 2 .

  Row 4: . . 4 .'
constraints:
- Each row contains digits 1-4 exactly once.
- Each column contains digits 1-4 exactly once.
- Each 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly once.
- There are three blue lines overlaid on the grid.
- 'Region Sum Line rule: On any given blue line, for each distinct 2x2 box the line
  passes through, the sum of the digits along the line within that box is equal; (the
  sum N may differ across lines, but must be equal within any box the line passes
  through).'
- 'Given initial board:

  Row 1: . 3 1 .

  Row 2: . 1 . .

  Row 3: . 4 2 .

  Row 4: . . 4 .'
