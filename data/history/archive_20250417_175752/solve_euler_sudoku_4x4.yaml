subtasks:
- id: analyze_constraints
  description: 'Analyze all constraints: digit distribution, color, unique digit-color
    pairs, sudoku row/col/box, thermos, and odd digit circles.'
  status: not_started
  order: 1
  inputs:
  - requirements file (data/requirements/euler_sudoku_4x4_with_thermo_and_colors.yaml)
  outputs:
  - Structured list of constraints and a visual schema of the board (positions, marked
    thermos, marked odd circles, constraint summary per cell).
- id: initialize_candidates
  description: Initialize possible candidates (digit, color) for each cell based on
    global constraints and per-cell restrictions (odd constraint, initial overlaps).
  status: not_started
  order: 2
  inputs:
  - Structured constraints and schema from previous step
  outputs:
  - Candidate sets of (digit, color) for every cell.
- id: apply_thermo_and_euler_logic
  description: Apply thermo Sudoku and Euler constraints to reduce candidates for
    the board without placements. Document inferences.
  status: not_started
  order: 3
  inputs:
  - Candidate sets of (digit, color), thermo layout, odd/circle constraints
  outputs:
  - Updated candidate sets for cells, narrowing possible initial placements. Documented
    logical deductions.
- id: make_first_placement
  description: Based on candidates and constraints, determine if any cell's value
    (digit and/or color) is forced, and make a confident first assignment.
  status: not_started
  order: 4
  inputs:
  - Updated candidate sets from previous step
  outputs:
  - Board state after first confident digit/color placement (row,col,value,color assigned).
    Reasoning for choice.
- id: update_candidates_after_placement
  description: Update candidates for all other cells given the first placementâ€”remove
    assigned digit/color from intersecting cells.
  status: not_started
  order: 5
  inputs:
  - Board state after first placement
  - previous candidate sets
  outputs:
  - Pruned candidates for all cells after first placement.
- id: iterate_logical_steps_to_solution
  description: 'Repeat logic (steps 3-5): make further placements as they become forced
    or highly constrained, document all deductions, until the board is solved.'
  status: not_started
  order: 6
  inputs:
  - Current board state
  - current candidate sets
  outputs:
  - Final solved board (all cell digit/color assignments), full logical path.
