title: Solve 4x4 Euler Sudoku Puzzle with Thermometers and Odd Circle
description: Solve the given 4x4 Euler Sudoku puzzle using digits 1 to 4, ensuring
  each digit appears once per row, column, and 2x2 box, with thermometer and odd-circle
  constraints. Start by determining one digit with certainty using logic.
constraints:
- Grid is 4x4; fill with digits 1-4.
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain all digits 1-4 (no repeats).
- 'Given initial board: row-wise: . 2 4 . / . 1 . . / . 4 2 . / . . 1 . (dots are
  blanks).'
- 'There are ''thermometer'' constraints: along a marked path, digits must strictly
  increase from bulb to tip.'
- At least one cell contains an 'odd circle', i.e., only an odd digit can be placed
  there.
- Only digit placement is required, not colors.
- First„ÄÅfocus on determining one certain digit placement using logic and constraints.
resources:
- 'Initial puzzle board: . 2 4 . / . 1 . . / . 4 2 . / . . 1 .'
- Thermometer paths and odd circle locations (to be provided or extracted as needed).
- Sudoku logic reasoning and constraint analysis.
