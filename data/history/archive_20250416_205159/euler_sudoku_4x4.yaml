title: Solve a 4x4 Euler Sudoku with color and thermometer constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku grid using digits 1-4 and 4 different colors. Each
  digit-color pair must appear exactly once in the grid. Each row, column, and 2x2
  box must contain each digit and each color exactly once. Thermometer constraint:
  digits on given thermos increase from bulb end. Odd constraint: specific cells must
  have odd digits.'
constraints:
- The grid size is 4x4.
- 'Digits: 1-4. Colors: 4 types (e.g., Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).'
- Each digit-color combination appears exactly once in the grid.
- Each row contains all digits (1-4) exactly once.
- Each column contains all digits (1-4) exactly once.
- Each 2x2 box contains all digits (1-4) exactly once.
- Each row contains all colors exactly once.
- Each column contains all colors exactly once.
- Each 2x2 box contains all colors exactly once.
- Digits on any given thermo must increase from the bulb (head) to the tip.
- 'Thermo given: r1c2 (bulb) → r2c3 → r3c3, i.e., cell (1,2) → (2,3) → (3,3).'
- 'Cells with gray circle must be odd: r1c2, r2c2, r3c4.'
- Odd digits are 1 and 3 (for digits 1-4).
