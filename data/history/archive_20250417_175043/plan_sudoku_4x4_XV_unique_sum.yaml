subtasks:
- id: analyze_and_model_puzzle
  order: 1
  description: Analyze all rules and constraints for the 4x4 Sudoku-like puzzle and
    formulate the problem explicitly as a mathematical/modeling problem. Clarify the
    required variables, grid definition, set/unique/box/sum/XV constraints.
  status: in_progress
  inputs:
  - requirements.yaml (extracted constraints, resources)
  outputs:
  - Formalized problem statement (list of variable/constraint definitions usable for
    solution search)
- id: enumerate_possible_sum_constants
  order: 2
  description: Based on the modeling, enumerate all feasible values for the sum constant
    x, given digit and box constraints.
  status: pending
  inputs:
  - Formalized problem statement
  outputs:
  - List of possible x values
- id: search_solutions
  order: 3
  description: Search for all grid assignments of digits 1-9 into the 4x4 grid that
    satisfy all constraints, for each possible sum constant x. Ensure no repeats in
    row/column/2x2 box, all sets in row/columns are unique, grid obeys given X/V clues.
  status: pending
  inputs:
  - Formalized problem statement
