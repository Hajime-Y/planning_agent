title: Solve the 4x4 Error Sudoku
description: Solve the 4x4 Error Sudoku with the given initial board state, logic
  constraints, sum clues, palindrome diagonal rule, and error-allowance rules per
  digit. Each deduction step must be confident.
constraints:
- 4x4 Sudoku grid with two 2x2 regions ("boxes") as standard boxes
- Each digit 1-4 must appear exactly four times overall
- 'For each digit n, n errors of that digit are allowed (unclear, possibly misstatement—likely
  each digit appears n times with error allowed for n instances: clarify if possible)'
- Sum clues for rows and columns (numbers not supplied here, so assume given or placeholder
  for step)
- A palindrome rule applies to a specified diagonal (the sequence must read the same
  forward and backward on that diagonal)
- 'Initial board is: r1: . 1 3 .  r2: . 2 . .  r3: . 2 1 .  r4: . . 4 4'
- Each step for solving must be based on confident logical deduction
- No guessing—only steps with unique logic/confidence
- Each placement at each step justified by constraints above
resources:
- Initial board as described
- Sudoku solving logic (standard + sum/palindrome/error rules)
- Sum clues for rows/columns (if specified)
- Palindrome diagonal specification
