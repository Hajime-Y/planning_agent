description: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with standard rules, additional knight's move
  restriction, and two thermo constraints. The grid and thermos are specified in the

  towards the tip.'
- Thermo 1 runs from r4c2 → r3c2 → r2c2; thermo 2 runs from r2c3 → r3c3.
- 'Initial grid: row-major, dots for empty: . 1 4 3 | . 4 . 2 | 4 3 2 1 | . 2 3 .'
resources:
- The initial grid configuration.
- Thermo shapes and positions.
