title: 4x4 Euler Sudoku Puzzle Solver
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Euler Sudoku puzzle with the current board state
  and the specified rules: Digits 1-4, Four colors, every digit/color combination
  appears exactly once, standard sudoku region constraints, thermometer (thermo) constraints,
  and odd-digit circle constraints. Each step should confidently place a single value.'
constraints:
- Digits 1-4 must appear exactly once in every row, column, and 2x2 box.
- Each color must be assigned to every cell, and every digit/color combination appears
  once in the grid.
- 'Thermometer (thermo) constraints: values along each thermometer shape must increase
  from bulb to tip.'
- 'Odd-digit circle constraint: specified cells (with circles) must contain odd digits.'
- Initial board state is provided (positions of some digits, colors, and clues).
- Each response must place only one confident value.
resources:
- Current 4x4 sudoku board state (digits and colors)
- List of thermometers (ordered cell positions for each thermometer)
- List of cells with odd-digit (circle) constraint
- Color/digit mapping table (if applicable)
