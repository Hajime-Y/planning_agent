title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with Black Dot and Colored Lines
description: 'Solve the provided 4x4 Sudoku puzzle (initial grid: . 3 4 2 | . 4 .
  3 | 3 1 2 4 | . 2 3 .) under normal 4x4 rules, with an extra black dot constraint
  (cells with a dot are in 1:2 ratio), and colored line constraints where the difference
  between adjacent digits specifies the number of such-adjacent differences along
  the line.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 sudoku rules: Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly
  once.'
- 'Black dot constraint: Cells separated by a black dot (r4c1 and r4c2) must be in
  1:2 ratio (i.e., one is double the other).'
- 'Palegreen line constraint: On the sequence (r3c1, r3c2, r4c3), for each possible
  adjacent difference d (abs), the number of adjacent pairs with difference d equals
  d.'
- 'Plum line constraint: On the sequence (r2c2, r2c3, r3c4, r4c4), same as above (adjacent
  pairs: the number with difference d == d).'
- 'Initial digits provided: r1 (.,3,4,2), r2(.,4,.,3), r3(3,1,2,4), r4(.,2,3,.)'
resources:
- Sudoku grid (4x4) with coordinates (r1c1~r4c4)
- List of colored lines and their cell coordinates
- Black dot constraint position
- Initial grid values
