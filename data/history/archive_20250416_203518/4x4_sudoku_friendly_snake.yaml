title: 4x4 Friendly Snake Sudoku Solver (Logical Step-by-Step)
description: Given a 4x4 Sudoku grid with special constraints regarding 'friendly'
  cells, a snake, and normal Sudoku rules, logically fill the board step-by-step,
  providing one confident placement and reasoning at each step.
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each number 1-4 appears once per row, column, and 2x2
  box.'
- Additional 'friendly' cells and 'snake' constraints apply (details assumed to be
  rules restricting certain placements or patterns).
- 'Initial board is:

  . 1 4 3

  . 3 . 1

  3 4 1 2

  . 2 3 .'
- The solution proceeds by making logically certain placements, one at a time, with
  reasoning for each.
resources:
- The provided initial Sudoku board.
- Rules for friendly cells (assume available externally or deducible).
- Rules for snake constraint (assume available externally or deducible).
- Basic Sudoku logic techniques.
