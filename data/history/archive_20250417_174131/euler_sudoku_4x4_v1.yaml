title: '4x4 Euler Sudoku with Thermometers: Logical Placement Plan'
description: 'Solve the 4x4 Euler Sudoku puzzle with the current board state:

  3 2 4 1

  . 1 . .

  . 4 2 .

  . . 1 .

  - Each row, column, and 2x2 box must have digits 1-4 and 4 different colors once
  each, no repeats.

  - Every digit/color combo unique on the grid.

  - Thermometers: digits must strictly increase from bulbs at r1c2, r2c2, r3c4.

  - Digit in any gray circle must be odd.

  Provide logical sequential placements to fully solve the puzzle.'
constraints:
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly once each.
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains each color exactly once.
- Every digit/color combination is unique in the grid (digit-color pair does not repeat).
- 'Thermometer lines: digits strictly increase from bulb to tip, with bulbs at r1c2,
  r2c2, r3c4.'
- The digit in any gray circle cell must be odd (cell(s) not specified, to be considered
  if present).
- Initial filled cells must not be changed.
resources:
- 'Initial board state (digit placements):

- 'Thermometer bulb cells: r1c2, r2c2, r3c4, with shapes defined by the puzzle.'
- Access to logic reasoning for sudoku, thermometers, Euler color constraints.
