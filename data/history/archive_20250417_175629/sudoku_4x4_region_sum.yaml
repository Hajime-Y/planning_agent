title: 4x4 Sudoku with Region Sum Lines - Step-by-step Forced Placement
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku with ''Region Sum Lines''. Use classic sudoku
  rules (each digit 1–4 per row, column, 2x2 box) AND the constraint that digits on
  each ''region sum line'' sum to the same total, with no repeated digits on a line.
  Start from the empty grid and given region sum lines. Step-by-step: analyze classic
  sudoku deductions and the region sum line constraints to make a forced cell placement.'
constraints:
- 'Classic 4x4 sudoku rules: Each digit 1–4 appears once per row, column, and 2x2
  box.'
- 'Region sum line constraints: Cells on the same line sum to the same value; digits
  do not repeat on a line.'
- Grid starts empty; region sum lines (with their cell coordinates) are provided.
- Solve step-by-step, making only forced placements (no guessing).
- At each step, analyze classic sudoku deductions and region sum line constraints
  together.
resources:
- Empty 4x4 sudoku grid
- 'List of region sum lines (each line: list of cell coordinates)'
- Pen and paper methods, or logical deduction techniques
