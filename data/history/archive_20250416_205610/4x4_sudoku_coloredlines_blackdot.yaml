title: 4x4 Sudoku Solver with Colored Lines and Black Dot Constraints
description: "Solve a 4x4 sudoku with these conditions:\n - Black dot: r4c1 and r4c2\
  \ must be in 1:2 ratio.\n - Colored lines: On palegreen (r3c1,r3c2,r4c3) and plum\
  \ (r2c2,r2c3,r3c4,r4c4),\n   the difference between two adjacent cells is used to\
  \ indicate, for each cell, the number of pairs along the line with that exact difference.\n\
  \ - Board is initially empty. All classic sudoku rules apply (1-4 in every row/col/box)."
constraints:
- Each row, column, and 2x2 region contains digits 1 through 4 without repetition.
- A black dot between r4c1 and r4c2 means one cell's value is exactly double the other's.
- On the palegreen line (r3c1, r3c2, r4c3), and the plum line (r2c2, r2c3, r3c4, r4c4),
  each cell along the line is annotated so the difference between two adjacent digits
  on the line reveals the number of adjacent pairs with that exact difference.
- All clues and constraints must be met; the starting board is entirely empty.
resources:
- Empty 4x4 sudoku grid
- Description and positional mapping of colored lines (palegreen and plum)
