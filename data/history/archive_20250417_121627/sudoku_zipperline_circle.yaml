title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku Puzzle with Zipper Line and Circle Constraints
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 sudoku puzzle using standard rules, with additional
  zipper line and circle constraints. The puzzle board is:

  . 4 1 . | . 1 . . | . 2 3 . | . . 2 .

  Zipper line: (r1c1, r2c1, r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c3, r4c4; r2c2, r2c3, r3c3)

  Circles at: r1c1, r2c1, r3c1, r4c2, r4c3, r2c4'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 sudoku rules: each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 once
  each.'
- 'Zipper line: The specified path (r1c1, r2c1, r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c3, r4c4; r2c2,
  r2c3, r3c3) adds an extra constraint (unspecified in the description - typically
  either unique, consecutive, sum, etc., must clarify if known).'
- 'Circles: Cells at specified positions may have additional constraints (e.g., even,
  odd, certain values; needs clarification if known).'
- 'Start grid: . 4 1 . | . 1 . . | . 2 3 . | . . 2 .'
- 'Visual elements: Zipper line path, circles at specified cells.'
