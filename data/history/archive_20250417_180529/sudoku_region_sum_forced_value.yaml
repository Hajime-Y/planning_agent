title: Find the next forced value in a 4x4 Region Sum Sudoku
description: Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with region sum line constraints. Identify
  the next cell with a forced value, make a single certain placement, and explain
  the logic. Region sum line constraints may link together non-contiguous cells that
  must sum to a certain value, in addition to standard sudoku rules. The process should
  only make one step/placement per execution, with a clear logical justification.
constraints:
- The sudoku is 4x4.
- Region sum line constraints are present and must be respected.
- Only a single, definite/forced value may be placed per execution.
- After placement, an explanation of the applied logic must be provided.
- Standard sudoku rules (unique digits per row, column, and box) must be respected.
- The step should be confidentâ€”no guessing allowed.
resources:
- The initial 4x4 sudoku puzzle (possibly as a grid or list format).
- The definitions and locations of region sum lines (with sum values and involved
  cell positions).
- Standard sudoku solving techniques.
