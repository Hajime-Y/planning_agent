title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku-like Puzzle with Extra Constraints
description: 'Solve the 4x4 sudoku-like puzzle:

  - Each row, column, and 2x2 box: unique digits (no repeats), plus unique sets of
  digits per row/col/box (no two rows/columns/boxes have the same combination of 4
  digits).

  - The sum of digits in each row/column/box is the same unknown value X (to be determined
  during solution).

  - Special clues: cells with ''V'' between them sum to 5; cells with ''X'' between
  them sum to 10 (like killer sudoku pairs).

  - Initial board: . 1 5 . / . 7 . . / . 4 2 . / . . 8 .

  - Visual constraints given: V between r1c1-r1c2 and r2c3-r3c3; X between r2c2-r2c3,
  r1c4-r2c4, r3c2-r4c2.

  - Confident placements should be provided one at a time.'
