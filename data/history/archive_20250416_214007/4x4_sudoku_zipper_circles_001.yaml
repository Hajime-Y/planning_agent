title: 4x4 Sudoku with Zipper Line and Circle Count Constraints
description: "Solve a 4x4 Sudoku where:\n- Standard Sudoku rules apply (each row,\
  \ column, and 2x2 box contains 1-4 exactly once).\n- There are Zipper Lines: For\
  \ any such line, the cells equidistant from the center sum to the digit in the middle.\n\
  - Some cells have circles: The digit in a circle indicates how many times that digit\
  \ appears in *circled* cells.\n- Given starting board:\n    . 4 1 2\n    . 1 . 3\n\
  \    1 2 3 4\n    . 3 2 .\n- Visual information: locations of zipper lines, and\
  \ positions of circled cells."
constraints:
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly once (standard 4x4 Sudoku).
- 'Cells on a Zipper Line: For any group of two opposite cells (equal distance from
  the center), their sum equals the digit in the central cell of the line.'
- 'A cell with a circle and digit d means: Across all circled cells, the digit d appears
  exactly d times (for all digits in circled cells).'
- Initial clues and visual structure as per the given board.
- Zipper line locations and circle locations are as per the puzzle design (input needed
  for precise constraints).
resources:
- Initial board with clues
- Zipper line (positions, center cells)
- Circle positions and initial circle digits
