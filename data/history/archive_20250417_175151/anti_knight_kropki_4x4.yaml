title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with Anti-Knight and Partial Kropki
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 sudoku puzzle. The puzzle must observe normal 4x4
  sudoku rules (each digit 1-4 appears once per row, column, and 2x2 box), plus: Anti-Knight
  constraint (no two same digits a knight''s move apart, as in chess), and Partial
  Kropki constraints (where clues exist, adjacent cells must follow white/black dot
  rules, otherwise, no Kropki constraint unless specified). Provided board: r1c1:3
  r1c2:4 r1c3:2 r1c4:. r2c1:. r2c2:. r2c3:4 r2c4:. r3c1:. r3c2:. r3c3:3 r3c4:4 r4c1:4
  r4c2:. r4c3:. r4c4:.'
constraints:
- Each digit 1-4 must appear exactly once in each row, column, and 2x2 box.
- 'Anti-Knight: Same digits cannot be a chess-knight''s move apart.'
- 'Partial Kropki: Where clues (dots) are present, adjacent cells must be consecutive
  (white dot) or in 1:2 ratio (black dot), but otherwise, no Kropki restrictions.'
- Start from the provided partial grid.
- All Kropki clues are partial/sparse; treat unmarked borders as unconstrained.
resources:
- The partially filled 4x4 grid as specified.
- List of Anti-Knight allowed/disallowed cell pairs (arise from grid).
- Partial Kropki constraints if specified (assume none in this task as not listed).
