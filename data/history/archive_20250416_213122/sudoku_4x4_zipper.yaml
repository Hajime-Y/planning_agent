title: 4x4 Zipper Line & Circle Sudoku Puzzle Solver
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku puzzle, following these rules: Normal Sudoku
  rules apply. Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the digits 1-4 exactly once.
  Additional rules: Digits an equal distance from the center of a gray ''Zipper Line''
  must sum to the digit in the middle of that line. A digit inside a circle indicates
  how many circles that digit appears in. Visual elements: A gray line (zipper) moves
  through cells r1c1, r2c1, r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c3, r4c4, and another through r2c2,
  r2c3, r3c3. Circles are at r1c1, r2c1, r3c1, r4c2, r4c3, and r2c4. The board is
  completely empty.'
constraints:
- The board is a 4x4 grid with cells addressable as r{row}c{col} (1-based).
- 'Normal Sudoku rules: Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain digits 1-4 exactly
  once.'
- 'Zipper Line constraints: Each gray line (zipper) connects certain cells. For each
  line, digits an equal distance from the center of the zipper line must sum to the
  digit in the center cell of the line.'
- 'On the ''main'' zipper, the cells are: r1c1, r2c1, r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c3, r4c4
  (bent through the left and bottom edges).'
- 'On the ''branch'' zipper, the cells are: r2c2, r2c3, r3c3.'
- For each zipper, the 'center cell' is defined as the cell(s) in the middle of the
  path (for odd length, one cell; for even, two central cells).
- 'Circle clue: A circle in a cell with digit n means that among all circled cells,
  digit n occurs exactly n times.'
- 'Circles are at: r1c1, r2c1, r3c1, r4c2, r4c3, r2c4.'
- The initial grid is empty; no givens.
