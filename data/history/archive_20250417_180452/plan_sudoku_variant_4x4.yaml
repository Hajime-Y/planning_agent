    constraints: &id001
    - Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain exactly the same 4 digits (subset
      of 1–9), no repeats per house.
    - 'Thermometer: digits on each thermometer strictly increase from the bulb to
      the tip.'
    - 'Black dot (between r4c3 and r4c4): those two cells must contain numbers in
      a 2:1 ratio (one cell is twice the value of the other).'
    - 'White dot (between r1c2 and r2c2): those two cells must be consecutive numbers
      (difference of 1).'
    - Cell r2c1 (gray square) must be an even number.
    - Initial digits as given in grid must be preserved.
    - 'Sudoku rules adapted for 4x4 grid: each house uses 4 digits drawn from 1–9.'
