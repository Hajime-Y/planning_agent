title: 4x4 Sudoku Puzzle Solver with Anti-Knight and Partial Kropki Constraints
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with Anti-Knight and Partial Kropki
  constraints. Board setup: 3 . 2 1 / 1 2 4 . / 2 1 3 4 / 4 . . . Visual elements:
  White dot between r1c3 and r1c4, black dot between r3c1 and r4c1.

  Anti-Knight: No identical digits may be a knight''s move apart. Partial Kropki:
  A white dot indicates two adjacent numbers differ by 1; a black dot indicates a
  ratio of 2. Only marked pairs are constrained, others are not.'
constraints:
- Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules apply (each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4
  without repeats).
- 'Anti-Knight constraint: No two identical digits may be placed such that they are
  a knight''s move apart (as in chess).'
- 'Partial Kropki constraints:'
- '  - White dot between r1c3 and r1c4: the digits in these cells must differ by 1.'
- '  - Black dot between r3c1 and r4c1: the digits in these cells must be in 1:2 ratio.'
- '  - No Kropki constraint applies to any other pair unless explicitly marked.'
- 'Initial board setup is: Row 1: [3, ., 2, 1], Row 2: [1, 2, 4, .], Row 3: [2, 1,
  3, 4], Row 4: [4, ., ., .] (''.'' indicates empty cell).'
