- id: parse_input
  description: Parse the raw board setup and constraints into structured data suitable
    for computation (e.g., 4x4 grid, and constraints dict/list).
  status: pending
  order: 1
  inputs:
    raw_board_setup: 3 . 2 1 / 1 2 4 . / 2 1 3 4 / 4 . . .
    raw_constraints:
    - Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules apply (each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits
      1-4 without repeats).
    - 'Anti-Knight constraint: No two identical digits may be placed such that they
      are a knight''s move apart (as in chess).'
    - 'Partial Kropki constraints:'
    - '  - White dot between r1c3 and r1c4: the digits in these cells must differ
      by 1.'
    - '  - Black dot between r3c1 and r4c1: the digits in these cells must be in 1:2
      ratio.'
    - '  - No Kropki constraint applies to any other pair unless explicitly marked.'
    - 'Initial board setup is: Row 1: [3, ., 2, 1], Row 2: [1, 2, 4, .], Row 3: [2,
      1, 3, 4], Row 4: [4, ., ., .] (''.'' indicates empty cell).'
  outputs:
    board: A 4x4 list of lists with int or None for empty cells.
    constraints_dict: A dict/list encoding all constraints for validation.
- id: prepare_validators
  description: Implement the Sudoku, Anti-Knight, and partial Kropki constraints as
    validation/check functions.
  status: pending
  order: 2
  inputs:
    constraints_dict: From parse_input
  outputs:
    validators: Set of callable constraint checking functions.
- id: solve_puzzle
  description: Using the board and validators, search for a solution satisfying all
    constraints (e.g., backtracking solver).
  status: pending
  order: 3
  inputs:
    board: From parse_input
    validators: From prepare_validators
  outputs:
    solved_board: Completed 4x4 board as list of lists
- id: output_solution
  description: Format and output the solution, verifying validity and converting to
    readable string if needed.
  status: pending
  order: 4
  inputs:
    solved_board: From solve_puzzle
  outputs:
    final_solution: String or array representing solved puzzle
    is_valid: Boolean
