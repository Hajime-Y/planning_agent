title: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku variant with digits 1–9 and special constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku variant puzzle with a given starting grid and special
  constraints:

  - Each row, column, and 2x2 box uses the same 4-digit subset from 1–9

  - Thermometer: digits increase from bulb end

  - Black dot: 2:1 ratio digit pair

  - White dot: consecutive digit pair

  - The cell r2c1 (gray square) is even

  Given grid:

  . 4 5 6

  . 5 . 8

  4 8 6 5

  . 6 8 .'
constraints:
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain exactly the same 4 digits (subset of
  1–9), no repeats per house.
- 'Thermometer: digits on each thermometer strictly increase from the bulb to the
  tip.'
- 'Black dot (between r4c3 and r4c4): those two cells must contain numbers in a 2:1
  ratio (one cell is twice the value of the other).'
- 'White dot (between r1c2 and r2c2): those two cells must be consecutive numbers
  (difference of 1).'
- Cell r2c1 (gray square) must be an even number.
- Initial digits as given in grid must be preserved.
- 'Sudoku rules adapted for 4x4 grid: each house uses 4 digits drawn from 1–9.'
resources:
- Provided starting grid.
- Definition of domino constraints (thermo, black/white dots).
