title: Solve a 4x4 sudoku puzzle with special dot and line constraints
description: 'Solve an empty 4x4 sudoku puzzle with: - Classic sudoku rules (1-4 in
  each row, column, 2x2 box)

  - Black dot between r4c1 and r4c2 (digits in 1:2 ratio)

  - palegreen line: r3c1 r3c2 r4c3; each adjacent digit difference appears exactly
  as pairs with that difference

  - plum line: r2c2 r2c3 r3c4 r4c4; same line constraint as above

  The board is otherwise empty.'
constraints:
- Each digit 1-4 must appear exactly once per row, column, and 2x2 box.
- 'Black dot between r4c1 and r4c2: the two digits are in a 1:2 ratio (i.e., one is
  double the other).'
- 'Palegreen line: cells r3c1, r3c2, r4c3. The difference between two adjacent digits
  on a colored line appears exactly as many times as the number of adjacent pairs
  with that difference.'
- 'Plum line: cells r2c2, r2c3, r3c4, r4c4. The difference between two adjacent digits
  on the line appears exactly as many times as the number of adjacent pairs with that
  difference.'
- No digits are given initially (the grid is empty).
