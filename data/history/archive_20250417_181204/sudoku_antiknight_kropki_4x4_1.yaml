title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with Antiknight and Partial Kropki Constraints
description: 'Given a 4x4 Sudoku board with antiknight and partial Kropki constraints,
  provide a certain logical deduction to place a single digit in a cell. The board
  and constraints are:

  Board:

  3 . 2 1

  1 2 4 .

  2 1 3 4

  4 . . .

  Kropki dots:

  - White dot between r1c3 and r1c4

  - Black dot between r3c1 and r4c1

  Antiknight means no two identical digits a knight''s move apart.'
constraints:
- The board is a 4x4 sudoku (digits 1,2,3,4 used in each row, column, and box).
- 'Antiknight constraint: identical digits cannot be placed a chess knight''s move
  apart.'
- 'Partial Kropki constraint: A white dot means the two cells are consecutive, a black
  dot means one cell is double the other, only for given pairs.'
- 'Two explicit Kropki dots: White between r1c3 and r1c4, Black between r3c1 and r4c1.'
- Leave a full logical trail and only place a digit where it is unambiguous/certain.

- Initial sudoku board (4x4, with digits and blanks)
- Kropki dot information (cell pairs and their dot types)
