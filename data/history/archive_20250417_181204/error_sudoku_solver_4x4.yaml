title: Solve 4x4 Error Sudoku and make a confident placement
description: 'Solve the 4x4 Error Sudoku puzzle with the given starting board and
  constraints:

  Initial board: . 1 3 2 / . 2 . 1 / 3 2 1 3 / . 1 4 .

  Constraints:

  1. Each digit 1-4 must appear exactly 4 times in the grid.

  2. Must make exactly N total errors (row, col, box repeat) for digit N (N = digit
  1-4).

  3. Row/column sums (row 1 <13, row 1 <7 [probable typo], row 4 >10, row 2 >10).

  4. Palindrome constraints: (r4c3,r4c4) and (r3c3, r2c4) pairs must be palindromic.

  5. Box definitions: box1 = r3c1 r3c2 r4c1 r4c2; box2 = r3c3 r3c4 r4c3 r4c4.'
constraints:
- Each of 1,2,3,4 appear exactly 4 times.
- 'For each digit N, the grid must contain exactly N errors (repeat of digit in row,
  col, or box: error = violation).'
- Row 1 sum less than 13.
- Row 1 sum less than 7 (possibly typo; make a note).
- Row 4 sum greater than 10.
- Row 2 sum greater than 10.
- 'Palindrome: r4c3 and r4c4 form a palindrome; r3c3 and r2c4 form a palindrome.'
- 'Boxes: Box1 = r3c1, r3c2, r4c1, r4c2; Box2 = r3c3, r3c4, r4c3, r4c4.'
