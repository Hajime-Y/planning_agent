title: 4x4 Cage Sudoku Solver with Prime Sums
description: 'Solve a given 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with cages whose sums are unique prime
  numbers. Each row and column must contain the digits 1-4 exactly once. Digits may
  repeat within each cage if allowed by constraints. Proceed step by step: in each
  response, make a single certain placement.'
constraints:
- The puzzle is played on a 4x4 grid.
- Each row must contain the digits 1-4 exactly once.
- Each column must contain the digits 1-4 exactly once.
- The grid is partitioned into cages.
- Each cage has a specified sum that is a unique prime number (no two cages have the
  same sum).
- Digits may repeat inside a cage, only standard row/column constraints prohibit duplication.
- At each step, only one certain cell is filled, using logical deduction (no guessing).
- Progress is made by repeatedly making single definitive placements until the puzzle
  is solved.
resources:
- The initial puzzle grid (empty or partially filled)
- The layout of cages and their prime sums
- A record of previously filled grid cells at each step
- Sudoku rules and list of prime numbers
- Logical deduction techniques
