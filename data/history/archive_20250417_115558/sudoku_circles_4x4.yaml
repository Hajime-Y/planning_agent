title: 4x4 Counting Circles Sudoku Solver
description: 'Solve the provided 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with counting circles. Initial
  board: . 4 2 . | . 2 . . | . 1 3 . | . . 1 . Special constraint: Any digit in a
  circle indicates exactly how many circles contain that digit.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the digits 1-4
  exactly once.'
- The board contains 'circles' (locations unspecified in problem statement, so by
  default, may be all cells or specified subset).
- If a digit appears in a cell with a circle, that digit indicates the total number
  of circles containing that digit on the board.
- 'The provided initial board is: ''. 4 2 . | . 2 . . | . 1 3 . | . . 1 .'''
- Empty cells are represented by '.'.
- All placements must satisfy both the Sudoku and counting circles constraint.
- Assume for this formulation that the circle positions are known or coincide with
  all cells for maximal generality（※ circle位置が実際に指定されていれば調整）.
