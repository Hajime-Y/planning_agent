title: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku Variant with Visual and Extra Logical Constraints
description: 'Solve an empty 4x4 Sudoku variant with these rules:

  1. Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain the same 4-digit subset from 1-9 (no
  repeats within group, but not necessarily entire 1-4 set).

  2. Thermometers: Along each thermometer, digits must strictly increase from the
  bulb to the end.

  3. Black dot between cells: The digits have a 2:1 ratio.

  4. White dot between cells: The digits are consecutive.

  5. The gray square must be an even number.

  6. All visual elements (such as thermometer, dots, the gray even cell) must be correctly
  taken into account.'
constraints:
- Each row must contain the same 4-digit subset from 1-9, no repeats within the row.
- Each column must contain the same 4-digit subset from 1-9, no repeats within the
  column.
- Each 2x2 box must contain the same 4-digit subset from 1-9, no repeats within the
  box.
- Digits along a thermometer must strictly increase from bulb to tip.
- Black dots between cells mean the two digits have a 2:1 ratio.
- White dots between cells mean the two digits are consecutive.
- Gray square must contain an even digit.
- Grid starts empty.
- All visual constraints (thermometers/dots/gray square) must be considered.
resources:
- Sudoku grid (4x4)
- 'Visual clues: thermometers (location unspecified), black dots, white dots, gray
  square'
- Digits 1-9 (must choose the same 4 digits subset for all rows/cols/boxes)
- Rules as specified above
