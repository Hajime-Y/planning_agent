title: 4x4 Euler Sudoku puzzle with digits, colors, thermo, odd digit constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Euler Sudoku, filling each cell with a digit (1-4) and a
  color (four different colors), such that each digit/color combination appears exactly
  once on the board, and each row, column, and 2x2 box has all four digits and all
  four colors. Additional constraints: ''thermo'' lines (with increasing digits from
  bulb), and gray circles (cells that must be odd digits) at r1c2, r2c2, r3c4. The
  starting board is empty.'
constraints:
- The Sudoku board is 4x4.
- Each cell contains both a digit (1-4) and a color (one of four different colors).
- Each digit/color combination appears exactly once on the board.
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains all four digits and all four colors (no repeats
  per row/col/box).
- 'Thermo: Along each lightgray line (thermo), digits must increase from the bulb
  towards the end.'
- 'Gray circles at cells r1c2, r2c2, r3c4 enforce: digit must be odd (1 or 3).'
- The initial board is empty.
resources:
- Sudoku solving knowledge and heuristics for digits and colors.
- Understanding of Euler (greek) Sudoku constraints.
- Thermo logic and odd cell constraints.
- Ability to represent and track candidates for each cell.
