version: 1
status: in_progress
subtasks:
- id: analyze_constraints
  description: Analyze standard and COUNTING CIRCLES Sudoku constraints to determine
    inference rules.
  status: not_started
  order: 1
  inputs:
  - Sudoku grid size and regions
  - Locations of circled cells
  - COUNTING CIRCLES rule description
  outputs:
  - Formalized operational statement of Sudoku and circle constraints
  - List of variables and constraint representations
- id: enumerate_possible_circle_assignments
  description: List all possible ways digits 1â€“4 can be assigned to circled cells,
    satisfying the COUNTING CIRCLES constraint.
  status: not_started
  order: 2
  inputs:
  - List of circled cells
  - COUNTING CIRCLES constraint formalized
  outputs:
  - Set of all possible valid digit assignments to circled cells (not necessarily
    considering Sudoku rules yet)
- id: propagate_sudoku_constraints
  description: For each possible circled cell digit assignment, propagate Sudoku (row/column/box)
    rules to further restrict possible entire-grid solutions.
  status: not_started
  order: 3
  inputs:
  - Possible circle assignments
  - Sudoku rules
  - Blank Sudoku grid
  outputs:
  - Reduced set of valid global assignments (whole grid)
- id: find_final_solution
  description: Determine which assignment(s), if any, result in a fully filled valid
    Sudoku grid (with all constraints satisfied, including the circle rule).
  status: not_started
  order: 4
  inputs:
  - Reduced set of valid assignments
  outputs:
  - Solution(s) to the 4x4 Sudoku (with cell values)
  - Indications of which cells are circled with which digit
