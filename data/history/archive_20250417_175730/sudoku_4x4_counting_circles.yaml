title: 4x4 Sudoku with COUNTING CIRCLES Constraint
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with the COUNTING CIRCLES constraint. Any
  digit written in a circled cell means that digit occurs in exactly that many circled
  cells. The Sudoku is initially empty. Circle locations are: r1c1, r1c2, r2c2, r2c3,
  r2c4, r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c4.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1â€“4, no
  repeats.'
- 'COUNTING CIRCLES constraint: If a number X appears in a circled cell, then the
  digit X must appear in exactly X of all circled cells (across the grid).'
- The initial puzzle is empty (no given digits).
- 'Circle locations: r1c1, r1c2, r2c2, r2c3, r2c4, r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c4 (cells are
  1-indexed).'
