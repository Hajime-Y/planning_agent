title: 4x4 sudoku puzzle with Sunburn constraints
description: Solve a 4x4 sudoku puzzle with normal sudoku rules and Sunburn constraints.
  Suns are at r2c2, r2c4, and r3c4. Each sun's digit equals the number of surrounding
  cells containing strictly smaller digits. Starting grid is empty.
constraints:
- '4x4 sudoku: Each digit 1-4 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 2x2 box.'
- 'Sunburn constraints: At each sun cell (r2c2, r2c4, r3c4), the digit must equal
  the number of strictly smaller digits in its 8 neighboring cells (surrounding in
  all 8 directions; edge/corner cells may have fewer neighbors).'
- Grid is empty to start.
- Only one solution is to be found (unique solution).
resources:
- Sudoku solver implementation (custom or existing)
- Ability to model and count strictly smaller neighbors for given cells
- Standard sudoku rules
- 4x4 grid representation
