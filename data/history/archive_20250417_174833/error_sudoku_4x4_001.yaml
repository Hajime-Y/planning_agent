title: Solve a 4x4 Error Sudoku with error and clue constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Error Sudoku:

  - Place digits 1-4 on a 4x4 grid so each appears exactly 4 times.

  - Digits may not repeat in a row, column, or box except: For each digit N, exactly
  N rule violations (errors) must occur (each violating pair counts as one error for
  its digit).

  - The grid has initial placements, row/column sum clues, and two palindrome lines.'
constraints:
- Each digit 1-4 must appear exactly 4 times in the entire grid.
- Standard Sudoku rules apply (no repeats in row/column/box) except error rule.
- For each digit N, exactly N pairs of the digit may violate the sudoku rule (repeat
  in a row/column/box).
- "Grid initial clues:\n r1: . 1 3 .\n r2: . 2 . .\n r3: . 2 1 .\n r4: . . 4 ."
- 'Boxes are: (r3c1, r3c2, r4c1, r4c2) and (r3c3, r3c4, r4c3, r4c4)'
- 'Palindrome lines must read the same forwards and backwards: [r4c3, r4c4], [r3c3,
  r2c4]'
- 'Sum clues: sum of r0c2 < 7, sum of r0c1 < 13, sum of r4c0 > 10, sum of r2c0 > 10'
resources:
- Grid structure with cell coordinates (rXcY, 1-indexed).
- Initial given digits and location.
- List of region (box) coordinates.
- Description of error-pair counting for each digit.
- Palindrome lines coordinates.
- Sum clue target cell/row/column relationships.
