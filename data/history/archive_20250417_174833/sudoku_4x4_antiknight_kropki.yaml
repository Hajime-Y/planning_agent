title: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku with Antiknight and partial Kropki constraints (make a first
  certain placement)
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with both antiknight and partial Kropki constraints.
  Given digits: r1c1=3, r1c3=2, r2c3=4, r3c3=3, r3c4=4, r4c1=4. Visual elements: white
  Kropki dot between r1c3 and r1c4; black Kropki dot between r3c1 and r4c1. Make a
  single certain placement for now.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain digits 1â€“4
  exactly once.'
- 'Antiknight constraint: no two identical digits can be a chess knight''s move apart.'
- 'Partial Kropki constraint:'
- '- A white Kropki dot between two cells means their digits are consecutive.'
- '- A black Kropki dot between two cells means their digits are in a 1:2 ratio.'
- '- Only shown dots are enforced (no dot means no restriction).'
- 'Givens: r1c1=3, r1c3=2, r2c3=4, r3c3=3, r3c4=4, r4c1=4'
- White Kropki dot between r1c3 and r1c4
- Black Kropki dot between r3c1 and r4c1
- 'Objective: Make a single certain placement (digit in a cell) based on all above
  constraints.'
resources:
- Initial Sudoku grid with specified givens and Kropki dots
- Sudoku and constraint-solving knowledge
- 4x4 grid mapping (cells r1c1 to r4c4)
