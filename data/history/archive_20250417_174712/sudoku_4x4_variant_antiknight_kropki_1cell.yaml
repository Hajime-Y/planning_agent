title: Solve a single cell in a 4x4 Sudoku variant with antiknight and partial Kropki
  rules
description: Solve the provided 4x4 Sudoku variant puzzle which includes the antiknight
  constraint, partial Kropki dots (white dot between r1c3 and r1c4, black dot between
  r3c1 and r4c1), and the given starting grid values. Make a logical and confident
  placement for one currently empty cell.
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 with
  no repeats.'
- 'Antiknight constraint: cells a knight''s move apart must not contain the same digit.'
- 'Partial Kropki constraints: a white Kropki dot between r1c3 and r1c4 (consecutive
  digits), a black Kropki dot between r3c1 and r4c1 (one is double the other).'
- Only the provided initial digits are given; all other cells are empty.
- You must use only direct, logical deduction (no guessing).
- Your answer must be a single confident placement of a digit in one empty cell, with
  reasoning.
