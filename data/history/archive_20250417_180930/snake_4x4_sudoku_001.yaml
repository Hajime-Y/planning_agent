title: Solve 4x4 Snake/Friendly Sudoku
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with the snake/friendly constraint.
  Normal sudoku rules apply. Additionally, a ''snake'' occupies all non-friendly cells
  (cells not matching their row, column, or box number), starting at r1c1, visiting
  every box at least once, containing only non-friendly cells, snaking orthogonally
  without touching itself. Only non-friendly cells are on the snake; friendly cells
  are not.The puzzle is:

  . 1 4 3

  . 3 . 1

  3 4 1 2

  . 2 3 .'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 2x2 box contains numbers 1-4 exactly
  once.'
- Given clues must be used as fixed values.
- A 'friendly' cell is a cell whose value equals its row, column, or box number (1-based
  indexing).
- All NON-friendly cells must be visited by a single contiguous 'snake' path.
- The snake starts in r1c1 (row 1, column 1).
- The snake path must visit at least one cell in every 2x2 box.
- The snake consists only of non-friendly cells and must not revisit/touch itself
  orthogonally.
- Only non-friendly cells are part of the snake; friendly cells are not on the snake.
- Cells not on the snake (i.e., friendly cells) must not be orthogonally adjacent
  to any other snake cell except via a snake head/tail.
