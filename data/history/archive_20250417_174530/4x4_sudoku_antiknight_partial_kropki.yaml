title: '4x4 Antiknight + Partial Kropki Sudoku: Confident Digit Placement'
description: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku with antiknight constraints and partial Kropki dots.
  Initial board is r1c1=3. White Kropki dot between r1c3/r1c4; black Kropki dot between
  r3c1/r4c1. Place one digit confidently using all constraints.
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each digit 1-4 appears exactly once per row, column,
  and 2x2 box.'
- 'Antiknight constraint: No two identical digits can be a chess knight''s move apart.'
- 'White Kropki dot: r1c3 and r1c4 are consecutive digits (difference is 1).'
- 'Black Kropki dot: r3c1 and r4c1 are in a 1:2 ratio (one is double the other).'
- Other adjacent cells do NOT have Kropki dots, so those pairs must NOT be consecutive
  or in a 1:2 ratio.
- 'Initial value: r1c1 = 3.'
- 'Goal: Use the constraints to deduce and confidently place at least one more digit.'
