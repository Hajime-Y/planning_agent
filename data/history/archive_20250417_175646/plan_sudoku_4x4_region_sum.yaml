subtasks:
- id: st1_analyze_initial_constraints
  description: Get and analyze the empty 4x4 grid and the coordinates of all region
    sum lines. Summarize initial constraints (such as obvious digit eliminations from
    region lines or sudoku rules).
  status: not_started
  order: 1
  inputs:
  - Empty 4x4 grid
  - List of region sum lines (with their cell coordinates)
  outputs:
  - Initial constraints summary (possible digits for each cell, line totals if deducible,
    etc.)
- id: st2_classic_sudoku_deduction
  description: Apply classic sudoku rules (row/col/box) to eliminate candidates for
    each cell.
  status: not_started
  order: 2
  inputs:
  - Initial constraints summary
  outputs:
  - Candidates for each cell after classic sudoku deduction
- id: st3_region_sum_line_deduction
  description: Update cell candidates by applying region sum line constraints (sum
    totals, uniqueness, combinations) in conjunction with sudoku deduction.
  status: not_started
  order: 3
  inputs:
  - Candidates for each cell after classic sudoku deduction
  - Region sum lines information
  outputs:
  - Candidates for each cell after both sudoku and region sum line deductions
- id: st4_identify_forced_placement
  description: Identify any cell where only one digit is possible (forced placement)
    due to combined constraints.
  status: not_started
  order: 4
  inputs:
  - Candidates for each cell after all deductions
  outputs:
  - A cell position and its forced digit (if any forced placement exists); or note
    if none exists
- id: st5_update_grid_and_repeat
  description: Place the forced digit in the identified cell, update the grid and
    all candidates accordingly, and repeat deduction steps until no further progress
    or until sudoku is solved.
  status: not_started
  order: 5
  inputs:
  - Current grid
  - Cell position with forced digit
  outputs:
  - Updated grid and candidate list
