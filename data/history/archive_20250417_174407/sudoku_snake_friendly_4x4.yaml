title: 4x4 Sudoku with Snake and Friendly Cells and First Logical Placement
description: "Solve a 4x4 sudoku applying two special rules: \n- Each row, column,\
  \ and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly once (standard sudoku rule)\n- Draw a\
  \ 1-cell-wide snake starting from the top-left cell;\n  * snake cannot visit friendly\
  \ cells, where the digit in the cell equals the row number, column number, or box\
  \ number\n  * snake must visit every 2x2 box at least once, cannot branch, must\
  \ not orthogonally touch itself\n  * the set of snake cells is exactly those not\
  \ friendly\n- Make the first logical placement in the solution process"
constraints:
- The Sudoku must respect all usual 4x4 Sudoku rules (rows, columns, boxes, digits
  1–4, no repeats)
- 'Friendly cell: a cell is friendly if the digit placed equals its row number, column
  number, or 2x2 box number (all 1–4; boxes ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom)'
- No snake segment passes through any friendly cell
- 'The snake: 1-cell wide, starts from the top-left (cell (1,1)), does not branch,
  must visit every 2x2 box at least once, cannot orthogonally touch itself'
- All non-friendly cells must be traversed by the snake; all friendly cells are not
  on the snake path
- The 'first logical placement' is the first cell (by human proof order) where a digit
  can uniquely and logically be placed
