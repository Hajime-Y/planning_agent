title: 4x4 Advanced Constraint Sudoku Solver
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 sudoku puzzle with advanced constraints, including:
  1. A black dot between r4c1 and r4c2 indicating a 1:2 digit ratio, 2. Additional
  color line rules (e.g., consecutive, non-repeating, etc.), 3. Digits may be placed
  only if logically forced by constraints.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 sudoku rules: Each row, column, and 2x2 region must contain digits
  1-4 without repeats.'
- There is a black dot between Row 4 Column 1 and Row 4 Column 2; those cells must
  have a 1:2 digit ratio (digits differ by double/half).
- Colored lines apply additional advanced/variant rules, e.g., consecutive values,
  sum constraints, etc. (details provided with the puzzle).
- A digit can be placed in a cell only if it is strictly logically forced by sudoku
  and advanced constraints.
- No guessing is allowed; all placements must be forced by logic.
