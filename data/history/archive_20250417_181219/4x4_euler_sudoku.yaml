title: 4x4 Euler Sudoku with Color, Thermometer, and Odd Constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Euler Sudoku according to the following rules:

  - Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the digits 1-4 and four different colors.-
  Each digit/color combination appears exactly once.

  - Digits along thermometers (starting at given bulbs) increase away from the bulb.

  - The digit in a gray circle is odd.

  - Starting grid is: ''. 2 4 1 | . 1 . 2 | 1 4 2 3 | . 3 1 .'' (interpreted as per
  rows; separator for clarity).'
constraints:
- Each row contains each digit (1-4) exactly once.
- Each column contains each digit (1-4) exactly once.
- Each 2x2 region contains each digit (1-4) exactly once.
- Each row contains each color exactly once.
- Each column contains each color exactly once.
- Each 2x2 region contains each color exactly once.
- Each digit/color pair occurs exactly once in the grid.
- 'Thermometer lines (given): digits along a thermometer strictly increase from bulb
  to end.'
- A gray circle indicates the digit at that cell is odd (1 or 3).
- Given digits as initial clues must be respected.
resources:
- Initial Sudoku grid (with digits given as '. 2 4 1 | . 1 . 2 | 1 4 2 3 | . 3 1 .')
- 'Information about thermometers: bulbs at r1c2, r2c2, r3c4, with respective thermometer
  paths.'
- Gray circles indicating odd digit placement.
- Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules.
- Color assignment rules and mapping between color/digit combinations.
