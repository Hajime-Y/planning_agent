title: 4x4 Sudoku with Variant Constraints
description: 'Solve the presented 4x4 Sudoku puzzle, taking into account not only
  the typical sudoku rules—each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain the same 4 distinct
  digits—but also additional variant constraints:thermometer (digits must strictly
  increase from bulb to tip), black dot (adjacent digits have a 2:1 ratio),white dot
  (adjacent digits are consecutive), and gray square (digit must be even).Start with
  the board:

  . 4 5 . /

  . 5 . . /

  . 8 6 . /

  . . 8 .'
constraints:
- Each row must contain 4 different digits from a specific 4-digit subset of 1-9.
- Each column must contain the same 4 digits as each row and 2x2 box.
- Each 2x2 box must contain the same 4 digits.
- 'Thermometer: digits must strictly increase from bulb to tip along thermometer shapes.'
- 'Black dot between cells: the digits must have a 2:1 ratio.'
- 'White dot between cells: the digits must be consecutive integers.'
- 'Gray square: the digit must be even.'
- Given digits are fixed and must not be changed.
resources:
- 'The initial Sudoku puzzle board: . 4 5 . / . 5 . . / . 8 6 . / . . 8 .'
- Descriptions (visual) of the variant constraints (locations of thermometers, black/white
  dots, gray squares) as provided.
