title: 4x4 Sudoku Variant Solver with Special Constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 sudoku variant where:

  - No digit repeats in rows, columns, or boxes

  - The set of digits in every row and column is unique

  - The sum in every row, column, and box is a constant x (to determine)

  - Adjacent cells with ''V'' sum to 5; with ''X'' sum to 10

  - Not all possible Vs/Xs are provided

  - Visual info: V between r1c1/r1c2, V between r2c3/r3c3, X between r2c2/r2c3, X
  between r1c4/r2c4, X between r3c2/r4c2

  - Empty start grid'
constraints:
- No digit repeats in any row, column, or 2x2 box.
- Each row and each column contains a unique set of digits (no two rows or columns
  have the same collection of digits).
- The sum of digits in every row, every column, and every 2x2 box is a single constant
  x (to be determined).
- If there is a 'V' between two adjacent cells, their digits sum to 5.
- If there is an 'X' between two adjacent cells, their digits sum to 10.
- 'Provided Vs and Xs: V between r1c1/r1c2, V between r2c3/r3c3, X between r2c2/r2c3,
  X between r1c4/r2c4, X between r3c2/r4c2.'
- Not all possible Vs and Xs are necessarily marked, i.e., there may be additional
  implied constraints.
- The initial board is fully empty.
