title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with Sun Constraint
description: 'Solve a given 4x4 sudoku puzzle, considering not only the classic rules
  (unique digits in row/col/block), but also the special sun (☀️) rule: the digit
  in each ☀️ cell equals the number of surrounding cells (8 directions) containing
  strictly smaller digits. Sun cells: r2c2, r2c4, r3c4. Initial board: . 4 2 .   |   .
  2 . .   |   . 3 1 .   |   . . 3 . '
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 sudoku rules: each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 with
  no repeats.'
- 'The board is initially:

  . 4 2 .

  . 2 . .

  . 3 1 .

  . . 3 .

  (Dot means empty)'
- For each 'Sun' cell (☀️), its digit equals the count of adjacent (8 surrounding)
  cells with strictly lower digits.
- 'Sun cell positions (in 1-based): r2c2, r2c4, r3c4.'
- 'Digits allowed: 1–4.'
- Solve for one valid solution.
