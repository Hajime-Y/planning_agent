title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with Killer and Little Killer Constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with the following info: Initial Numbers:
  r1c2:2, r1c3:1, r2c2:4, r3c2:3, r3c3:4, r4c3:3. Killer Cages: (r1c1,r1c2) sum=5;
  (r2c1,r2c2,r3c2) sum=8; (r2c4,r3c4) sum=4. Little Killer: black arrow at r1c5 pointing
  lower left, sum=8. Fill according to classic sudoku, killer, and little killer.'
constraints:
- 'Classic 4x4 Sudoku constraints: each digit 1-4 appears once in each row, column,
  and 2x2 box.'
- 'Initial numbers must be set as: r1c2:2, r1c3:1, r2c2:4, r3c2:3, r3c3:4, r4c3:3.'
- 'Killer cages must sum as specified: (r1c1, r1c2)=5; (r2c1,r2c2,r3c2)=8; (r2c4,r3c4)=4.'
- 'Little killer constraint: a diagonal from right of r1 (r1c5) down to left through
  the grid sums to 8.'
- All constraints (classic, killer, little killer) must be satisfied simultaneously.

- 4x4 sudoku grid
- List of initial numbers
