title: 4x4 Euler Sudoku Solver with Colors and Visual Constraints
description: 'Solve the provided 4x4 Euler Sudoku puzzle. The puzzle uses digits 1-4
  and colors (each row, column, box contains each color once), with extra visual constraints
  like thermos and odd/even indicators. Initial board: . 2 4 . / . 1 . . / . 4 2 .
  / . . 1 . and visual elements.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku: each digit 1-4 appears exactly once per row, column, and 2x2
  box.'
- 'Euler Sudoku color rule: each of 4 colors appears once per row, column, and 2x2
  box.'
- 'Given board state: . 2 4 . / . 1 . . / . 4 2 . / . . 1 .'
- 'Additional visual constraints: thermos (digits must increase along marked thermometers),
  odd (cells must have odd digits) or even circles, etc.'
- All standard Sudoku and color/Euler rules must be satisfied together with the visual
  constraints.

- Initial Sudoku grid (4x4) with given digits.
