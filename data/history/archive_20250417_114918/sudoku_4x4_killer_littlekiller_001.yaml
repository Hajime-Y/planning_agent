title: 4x4 Killer + Little Killer Sudoku Solver
description: 'Solve the provided 4x4 Sudoku puzzle using the given initial clues,
  killer cage sums, and a little killer diagonal constraint. The goal is to fill the
  grid with digits 1–4 such that:

  - Each digit appears exactly once in each row, column, and 2x2 box

  - Each killer cage''s digits sum to the given value

  - The minor diagonal (little killer) sum constraint is satisfied.'
constraints:
- '4x4 grid: Each row, column, and 2x2 box must contain digits 1–4 exactly once'
- 'Initial grid clues: (r1c1: blank, r1c2: 2, r1c3: 1, r1c4: blank), (r2c1: blank,
  r2c2: 4, r2c3: blank, r2c4: blank), (r3c1: blank, r3c2: 3, r3c3: 4, r3c4: blank),
  (r4c1: blank, r4c2: blank, r4c3: 3, r4c4: blank)'
- 'Killer cage (sum 5): r1c1, r1c2'
- 'Killer cage (sum 8): r2c1, r2c2, r3c2'
- 'Killer cage (sum 4): r2c4, r3c4'
- 'Little killer diagonal sum 8: minor diagonal indicated by arrow from r1c5 (i.e.,
  r1c4, r2c3, r3c2, r4c1, or as described in task, here likely r1c4, r2c3, r3c2, r4c1)
  sums to 8'
- Each cell must contain an integer 1–4
resources:
- Initial grid (with clues)
- Killer cage definitions and sums
