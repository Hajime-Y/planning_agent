title: Solve a 4x4 variant Sudoku puzzle with advanced constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 variant Sudoku puzzle with digits 1-9. The constraints are:
  - No repeats in any row, column, or 2x2 box.- Each row, column, and box must have
  a unique set of digits (no two rows, columns, or boxes may contain the same combination,
  regardless of order).- The digits in every row, column and box sum to an unknown
  constant x (to be deduced).- ''V'' between specific cell pairs denotes their sum
  is 5.- ''X'' between specific cell pairs denotes their sum is 10.- Initial givens:
  r1c2=1, r1c3=5, r2c2=7, r3c2=4, r3c3=2, r4c3=8; others empty.- The aim is to identify
  one cell where a value is forced and fill it with explanation.'
constraints:
- Sudoku is a 4x4 grid using digits 1-9 (not 1-4!).
- No repeats within any row, column, or 2x2 box.
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box must have a unique set of digits (no identical sets).
- Digits in each row, column, and box sum to the same value x (unknown, must be deduced).
- '''V'' between r1c1/r1c2 and r2c3/r3c3 enforces those two cells sum to 5.'
- '''X'' between r2c2/r2c3, r1c4/r2c4, r3c2/r4c2 enforces those two cells sum to 10.'
- 'Initial state: r1c2=1, r1c3=5, r2c2=7, r3c2=4, r3c3=2, r4c3=8; all others empty.'
