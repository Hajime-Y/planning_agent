title: 4x4 Euler Sudoku Solver with Thermometers and Odd/Even Constraints
description: Solve a 4x4 Euler Sudoku with additional thermometer and odd/even constraints.
  Digits 1-4 appear once per row, column, and box; each cell gets a color such that
  every digit/color combination is unique; digits increase along the thermometers
  (r1c2 → r2c3 → r3c3); and the digits in specific cells (r1c2, r2c2, r3c4) are odd.
constraints:
- Grid is 4x4; each cell receives a digit 1-4.
- 'Standard Sudoku: Each digit occurs once per row, column, and 2x2 box.'
- Each cell has a color; each digit-color combination appears exactly once in the
  grid (Euler constraint).
- A thermometer runs from r1c2 → r2c3 → r3c3; digits must strictly increase in this
  order.
- Cells r1c2, r2c2, r3c4 must be filled with an odd digit (1 or 3).
resources:
- Empty 4x4 Sudoku grid with cells indexed as r{row}c{column}.
- Information on thermometer path and which cells have oddness restriction.
- Known Sudoku/Euler Sudoku solving techniques.
