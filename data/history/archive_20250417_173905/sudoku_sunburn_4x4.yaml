title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with sun clues
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with SUNBURN (☀️) clues. Each sun
  cell contains a digit; the digit indicates how many neighboring (orthogonally and
  diagonally adjacent) cells have strictly smaller digits. Normal Sudoku rules apply
  (each digit 1-4 in every row, column, and 2x2 box). The board starts as:

  . 4 2 .

  . 2 . .

  . 3 1 .

  . . 3 .

  Suns (☀️) at r2c2, r2c4, r3c4. Task: Fill a cell with a value you are confident
  about.'
constraints:
- '4x4 Sudoku: Each row, column, and each 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly once.'
- Suns (☀️) at r2c2, r2c4, r3c4 have a digit that equals the number of adjacent cells
  with strictly smaller digits.
- 'Initial grid is:

  . 4 2 .

  . 2 . .

  . 3 1 .

  . . 3 .'
- Fill one 'confident' cell (not whole solution required)—determine a cell that can
  be uniquely and surely deduced.
