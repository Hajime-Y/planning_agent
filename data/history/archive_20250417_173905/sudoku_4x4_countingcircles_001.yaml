title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with COUNTING CIRCLES constraint
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku with the additional ''COUNTING CIRCLES'' constraint:
  each digit in a cell with a circle tells how many times that digit appears in all
  circle-marked cells. Use logic to confidently place at least one number and explain
  the reasoning.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 2x2 block contains digits 1-4
  with no repeats.'
- 'There are special cells (circles) at these positions: r1c1, r1c2, r2c2, r2c3, r2c4,
  r3c1, r4c1, r4c2, r4c4.'
- '''COUNTING CIRCLES'': If a circle cell contains digit x, then there must be exactly
  x circle-cells in the grid that also contain digit x.'
- 'Initial givens: r1c1 (.), r1c2 (4), r1c3 (2), r1c4 (.), r2c1 (.), r2c2 (2), r2c3
  (.), r2c4 (.), r3c1 (.), r3c2 (1), r3c3 (3), r3c4 (.), r4c1 (.), r4c2 (.), r4c3
  (1), r4c4 (.).'
- Make at least one confident placement and provide reasoning.
