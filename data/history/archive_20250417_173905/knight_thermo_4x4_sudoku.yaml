title: Solve 4x4 sudoku with knight's move and thermo constraints
description: "Solve a 4x4 sudoku puzzle with empty board, with additional rules: \n\
  - Digits may not repeat at a knight's move distance (like in chess)\n- Digits along\
  \ a given thermo must strictly increase from the bulb\nThermo 1: r4c2 (bulb) → r3c2\
  \ → r2c2\nThermo 2: r2c3 (bulb) → r3c3\n"
constraints:
- Standard rules of 4x4 sudoku (digits 1-4, no repeats in row, column, box)
- Digits on cells separated by a knight's chess move cannot be the same
- On each thermo, digits must strictly increase from the bulb towards the tip
- Thermo 1 starts at r4c2 (bulb), continues r3c2, ends r2c2 (3 cells)
- Thermo 2 starts at r2c3 (bulb), ends at r3c3 (2 cells)
- Board is empty (no clues given initially)
resources:
- Empty 4x4 board
- 'Indexing: rows 1-4 top to bottom, columns 1-4 left to right'
- Mapping of knight's moves for 4x4 board
- 'Thermo positions: [(4,2),(3,2),(2,2)] and [(2,3),(3,3)]'
