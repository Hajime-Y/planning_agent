title: 4x4数独変種（数字＋カラー＋温度計＋グレー奇数制約）を解く
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku variant: place digits 1-4 and 4 different
  colors exactly once in each row, column, and box; every digit/color combination
  must appear exactly once. Thermometers: digits increase from the bulb end. Circles
  are gray and a gray circled digit is odd. Initial values: r1c2=2, r1c3=4, r2c2=1,
  r3c2=4, r3c3=2, r4c3=1.'
constraints:
- The puzzle is a 4x4 Sudoku grid.
- Digits 1-4 must be placed exactly once in each row, column, and 2x2 box.
- There are 4 different colors; each color must appear exactly once in each row, column,
  and box.
- 'For each digit/color combination, it must appear exactly once in the puzzle: no
  repeated digit/color pairs.'
- 'Certain cells have thermometers: digits must strictly increase from the bulb (base)
  to the tip.'
- Cells with a gray circle must contain an odd digit (1 or 3).
- 'Initial digit placements: r1c2=2, r1c3=4, r2c2=1, r3c2=4, r3c3=2, r4c3=1.'
- The objective is to fill the entire grid with valid digits and colors that satisfy
  all of the above constraints.
resources:
- 'Initial board state: r1c2=2, r1c3=4, r2c2=1, r3c2=4, r3c3=2, r4c3=1'
- Information about thermometers and their shapes & locations (assumed to be provided/pictured).
- Information about which cells are gray-circled.
- 'Set of 4 colors: to be named arbitrarily if not specified, e.g. Red, Blue, Green,
  Yellow.'
