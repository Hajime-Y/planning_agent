title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku variant with X/V clues
description: "Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle variant where:\n - Normal sudoku rules do\
  \ not apply.\n - Fill the grid with digits 1-9 so that no digit repeats within any\
  \ row, column, or 2x2 box.\n - Each row, column, and box must use a unique set of\
  \ digits (e.g., different combinations within each house).\n - The sum of digits\
  \ in each row, column, and box is constant (but unknown, needs deduction).\n - If\
  \ there's an X between two cells, their sum must be 10. If V, their sum must be\
  \ 5.\n - Solve via step-by-step logical deductions, explaining each placement."
constraints:
- Grid is 4x4.
- Fill using digits 1â€“9.
- No digit may repeat in any row, column, or 2x2 box.
- Each row, column, and box must contain a unique set of digits (no identical combination
  in the houses).
- Sum of digits in every row, column, and box is the same (unknown; deduce as part
  of solution).
- X-marked adjacent cells must sum to 10.
- V-marked adjacent cells must sum to 5.
- Proceed step-by-step, providing logical deductions and reasoning for each placement.
