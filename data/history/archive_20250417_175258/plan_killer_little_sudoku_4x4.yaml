    - cells:
      - !!python/tuple
        - r1c1
        - r1c2
      sum: 5
    - cells:
      - !!python/tuple

      sum: 8
  outputs:
    board: Empty 4x4 Sudoku board as a suitable data structure
    constraints: List/structure of all constraints encoded for the solver
- id: subtask_02
  order: 2
  description: Apply initial constraint propagation (e.g., eliminate impossible values
    by analyzing killer cage and little killer sums) to reduce candidates for each
    cell.
  status: open
  inputs:
    board: Board from subtask_01
    constraints: Constraints from subtask_01
  outputs:
    candidates: For each cell, updated possible digit candidates
- id: subtask_03
  order: 3
  description: Search for a solution using constraint-based and backtracking strategy,
    considering all constraints.
  status: open
  inputs:
    candidates: Candidates from subtask_02
    constraints: Constraints from subtask_01
  outputs:
    solution: One completed 4x4 Sudoku grid that meets all the constraints
- id: subtask_04
  order: 4
  description: Validate and format the solution, ensuring all constraints are satisfied
    and outputting the result clearly.
  status: open
  inputs:
    solution: Solution from subtask_03
    constraints: Constraints from subtask_01
  outputs:
    validation_result: Validity check (True/False), and formatted board
