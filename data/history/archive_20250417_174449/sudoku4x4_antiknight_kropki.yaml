title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with Anti-Knight and Partial Kropki Constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle under these constraints:

  - Cells contain numbers 1â€“4, no repeats per row/column/box.

  - Anti-Knight: Cells at a chess knight''s move apart cannot have the same value.

  - Partial Kropki: White dot between r1c3 and r1c4 (consecutive); Black dot between
  r3c1 and r4c1 (x2).

  - Initial value: r1c1 = 3, the rest are empty.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 with
  no repeats.'
- 'Anti-Knight constraint: cells that are a chess knight''s move away cannot contain
  the same digit.'
- 'Kropki constraints: a white dot between r1c3 and r1c4 (those cells must be consecutive
  numbers), a black dot between r3c1 and r4c1 (one must be double the other).'
- 'Initial value: row 1, column 1 is 3. All other cells are empty.'
