title: Zipper 4x4 Sudoku Solver
description: Solve the 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with special zipper and circle clues. Normal
  Sudoku rules apply (no repeats in rows, columns, or boxes). On the zipper line,
  digits at equal distance from the center sum to the central digit. If a digit is
  placed in a circle, its value is the count of circles containing that digit. The
  board is initially empty.
constraints:
- '4x4 Sudoku grid: fills with digits 1-4'
- No repeats in any row, column, or 2x2 box (Standard Sudoku rules)
- A designated Zipper Line exists (gray line).
- 'On the Zipper Line: For any pair of cells equally distant from the center, their
  sum equals the digit in the center cell of the line.'
- 'Circle constraint: If a digit sits in a circled cell, that digit indicates how
  many circles it appears in on the grid.'
- The initial board starts empty (no givens).
