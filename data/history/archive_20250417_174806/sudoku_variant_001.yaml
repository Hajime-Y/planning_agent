title: 4x4 Sudoku Variant Solver with Thermometer and Dot Constraints
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 Sudoku variant with extra constraints: Place the
  same 4-digit subset (from 1–9) in each row, column, and 2x2 box. There are thermometers
  (cells must increase along the bulb to tip), a gray square (r2c1, must be even),
  a white dot (between r1c2/r2c2: values must be consecutive), and a black dot (between
  r4c3/r4c4: 2:1 ratio). Initial digits: r1c2=4, r1c3=5, r2c2=5, r3c2=8, r3c3=6, r4c3=8.'
constraints:
- Place the same 4-digit subset (from 1–9) in each row, column, and 2x2 box (no repetitions
  in each).
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the same subset of 4 digits chosen from 1–9.
- 'Thermometers: cells along the thermometer shapes must increase from bulb to tip.'
- Gray square at row 2, column 1 must be an even digit.
- 'White dot between r1c2/r2c2: values must be consecutive (1 apart in either direction).'
- 'Black dot between r4c3/r4c4: values must have a 2:1 ratio.'
- 'Given digits: r1c2=4, r1c3=5, r2c2=5, r3c2=8, r3c3=6, r4c3=8.'
resources:
- Sudoku puzzle grid (4x4)
- Locations of thermometers, white dot, black dot, gray square
- Initial digit placements
