title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with unique sum and constraint clues
description: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku variant using digits 1-9 (no repeats per row/col/box,
  all digits unique in row/col), where each row/column/box sums to an unknown total
  x, which must be deduced, and specified V(XV) constraints (V:sum5, X:sum10) are
  given between some cells. You must find a cell with only one possible value and
  specify its placement.
constraints:
- Sudoku grid is 4x4.
- Use digits 1-9. Each row, column, and box must not repeat digits.
- The sum of each row, column, and box is the same unknown integer x (to be found).
- Set of digits in each row/column is unique (no two rows or columns have the same
  four digits).
- 'V constraint: The two adjacent cells sum to 5.'
- 'X constraint: The two adjacent cells sum to 10.'
- 'Given constraints: V between r1c1-r1c2 and r2c3-r3c3; X between r2c2-r2c3, r1c4-r2c4,
  r3c2-r4c2.'
- Not all X's and V's are necessarily given.
- Find and specify a cell that has only one possible value.
