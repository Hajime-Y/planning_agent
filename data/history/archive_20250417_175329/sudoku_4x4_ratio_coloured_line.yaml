title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with ratio dots and special coloured line constraints
description: 'Solve a given 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. Extra constraints:

  • Digits separated by a black dot must be in a 1:2 ratio.

  • A palegreen line connects r3c1, r3c2, r4c3.

  • A plum line connects r2c2, r2c3, r3c4, r4c4.

  • The difference between two adjacent digits on a coloured line tells you how many
  pairs of adjacent digits along that line have exactly that difference.

  • There is a black dot between r4c1 and r4c2.

  Board so far: . 3 4 . / . 4 . . / . 1 2 . / . . 3 .'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly
  once.'
- Digits separated by a black dot (r4c1 and r4c2) must be in a 1:2 ratio (e.g., 1-2,
  2-4).
- On each coloured line, the difference between two adjacent digits must equal the
  number of pairs of adjacent digits along that line having that exact difference.
- 'Palegreen line: r3c1 - r3c2 - r4c3.'
- 'Plum line: r2c2 - r2c3 - r3c4 - r4c4.'
- 'Initial board: . 3 4 . / . 4 . . / . 1 2 . / . . 3 . (rows 1-4, columns 1-4)'

- Sudoku rules knowledge
