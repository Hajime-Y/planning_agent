title: 4x4 スドク + Renban線 次の論理的配置
description: 'Given a 4x4 Sudoku grid with specific violet Renban lines and certain
  filled digits, deduce and make the next step (a single, uniquely forced placement)
  according to standard Sudoku and Renban rules. Renban lines: cells listed as in
  the task statement.'
constraints:
- Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules (each row/column/box has digits 1–4, non-repeating)
- 'Violet Renban lines: cells on each line must contain a set of consecutive digits
  in any order (not necessarily sequential, but the set must be a block, e.g. 1-2-3
  or 2-3-4)'
- 'Only one digit is to be placed this step: it must be a uniquely forced placement
  by logic under current constraints'
- 'Input data: starting board (cell coordinates and known digits), list of Renban
  line cell groups'
resources:
- Sudoku board parser for 4x4
- Renban line cell group parser and validator
- Logic deduction tools for constraint propagation
- Visual or data representation for current board and candidates
