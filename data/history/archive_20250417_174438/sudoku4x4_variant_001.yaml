title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku Variant with Extra Constraints
description: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku variant where each row, column, and 2x2 box contains
  the same subset of 4 digits taken from 1–9. Thermometer lines require digits to
  increase from bulb to tip. Black dots indicate a 2:1 digit ratio between adjacent
  cells. White dots indicate consecutive digits. A gray square (at r2c1) must contain
  an even number. The starting grid is empty.
constraints:
- Grid size is 4x4.
- Each row, column, and each 2x2 box contains the same subset of 4 digits (digits
  selected from 1–9, no repeats).
- 'Thermometer lines: digits must strictly increase from bulb to tip.'
- 'Black dots: adjacent cells must have digits in a 2:1 ratio (one double the other).'
- 'White dots: adjacent cells must contain consecutive digits (difference of 1).'
- r2c1 (row 2, column 1) contains an even number.
- Starting grid is empty.
resources:
- Sudoku grid (4x4)
- List of thermometers (positions unknown in this description)
- List of black dots (adjacency unknown in this description)
- List of white dots (adjacency unknown in this description)
- Gray square position (r2c1)
- 'Digit set: 1–9'
