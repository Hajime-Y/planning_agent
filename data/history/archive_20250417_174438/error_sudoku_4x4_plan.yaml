title: 4x4 Error Sudoku Puzzle Solution Plan
description: Solve the 4x4 'Error sudoku' puzzle by filling the grid with digits 1-4
  (each exactly four times), complying with error constraints per digit, classic sudoku
  rules (with allowed intentional errors), palindromic constraints on certain lines,
  and outside row/column sum clues. Specific 2x2 boxed regions are defined. The grid
  starts empty.
constraints:
- Fill a 4x4 grid with digits 1-4, each used exactly 4 times.
- 'Rule: Normally, digits do not repeat in any row, column, or 2x2 region, but intentional
  ''errors'' are allowed per digit: Digit 1 must have 1 error (one violation of unique
  constraint), 2 has 2 errors, 3 has 3 errors, 4 has 4 errors.'
- Count an 'error' as a repeated digit in any row, column, or specified 2x2 region.
- 'Palindromic constraint: r4c3-r4c4 (i.e., grid[3][2], grid[3][3]) must read same
  forwards/backwards; r3c3-r2c4 must be palindromic.'
- 'Row and column sums: sum of c1 < 13, sum of c2 < 7, sum of r4 > 10, sum of r2 >
  10.'
- 2x2 regions are r3c1,r3c2,r4c1,r4c2; and r3c3,r3c4,r4c3,r4c4.
- The puzzle starts with an empty grid.
