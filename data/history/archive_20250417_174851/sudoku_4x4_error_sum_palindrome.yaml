title: 4x4 Error Sudoku solver with sum and palindrome constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Error Sudoku puzzle where, in addition to standard Sudoku
  rules, there are particular error/mistake constraints, row/column sum constraints,
  and palindrome constraints. Current board: . 1 3 . / . 2 . . / . 2 1 . / . . 4 .'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly
  once.'
- 'Error Sudoku: Possibly, there are additional rules or mistakes introduced; needs
  explicit definition.'
- 'Row/column sum constraints: Some or all rows/columns must sum to specified totals
  (sums not given in original prompt, need clarification if missing).'
- 'Palindrome constraint: Some rows, columns, or blocks must read the same forwards
  and backwards; specific locations must be clarified.'
- 'Given board: . 1 3 . / . 2 . . / . 2 1 . / . . 4 . (''.'' = blank)'
- Solve for the unique, valid solution respecting all stated constraints.
