title: 4x4 Sudoku with Prime Sum Cages
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku in which each row and column contains the digits
  1-4 exactly once. Cages are groups of cells as specified, and the digits in a cage
  sum to a prime number. No two cages can have the same prime total, but digits inside
  a cage may repeat. Cages: (1) r1c2 r1c3 r2c3, (2) r1c4 r2c4 r3c3 r3c4 r4c3 r4c4,
  (3) r2c2 r3c2 r4c1 r4c2, (4) r1c1 r2c1 r3c1.'
