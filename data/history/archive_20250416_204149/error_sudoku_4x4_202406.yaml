title: Solve 4x4 Error Sudoku with Unique Constraints
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Error Sudoku with digit repetition and violation constraints,
  sum/inequality clues, special regions (boxes), and palindrome lines. Goal: Logically
  deduce and confidently place a digit in a specific cell.'
constraints:
- The sudoku grid is 4x4.
- Each digit 1 to 4 must be used exactly 4 times in the entire grid.
- For digit N, there must be exactly N violations of standard sudoku rules caused
  by that digit.
- 'Standard rules: 1 digit per row, column, and region box.'
- 'Boxes (regions) are at: r3c1 r3c2 r4c1 r4c2 (2x2 bottom-left), r3c3 r3c4 r4c3 r4c4
  (2x2 bottom-right).'
- 'Palindrome lines exist at: r4c3–r4c4, and r3c3–r2c4.'
- 'Palindrome: digits along the marked line must form the same sequence forwards and
  backwards.'
- 'Inequality clues: <13 at r0c1 means column 1 sum <13, <7 at r0c2 means column 2
  sum <7, >10 at r4c0 means row 4 sum >10, >10 at r2c0 means row 2 sum >10.'
- 'Final goal: Find at least one cell whose value can be determined with logical certainty.'
resources:
- Sudoku grid (4x4) with blank cells.
- 'Digit pool: 1-4, used exactly 4 times each.'
- List of constraint rules specified above.
- Clues for sum/inequality, palindrome lines, and boxes.
