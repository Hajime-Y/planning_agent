title: 4x4 Killer Sudoku with Prime-sum Cages Solver
description: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle with given starting clues and killer cage constraints.
  Each killer cage must sum to a unique prime, possibly with repeated digits within
  a cage.
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: digits 1–4 in every row, column, and 2x2 box with no
  repeats.'
- 'Starting clues: r1c2=2, r1c3=1, r2c2=3, r3c2=4, r3c3=3, r4c3=4 (r=row, c=column;
  indices 1-based).'
- 'Killer cages: each cage consists of one or more cells; the digits in a cage sum
  to a unique prime number.'
- Digits in the same cage can repeat (repetition allowed within a cage).
- Different cages must have different prime sums.
- All cage constraints and given clues are to be respected in the solution.
resources:
- 'List of all 4x4 Sudoku possible digits: 1,2,3,4'
- Prime numbers up to the maximum possible cage sum (e.g., 4×4=16).
- Killer cage definitions (to be provided or inferred if not explicitly defined in
  task).
