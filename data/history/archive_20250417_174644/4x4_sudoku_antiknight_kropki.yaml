title: '4x4 Sudoku with Anti-Knight & Partial Kropki Constraints: Single Placement
  Deduction'
description: 'Solve the given 4x4 sudoku under anti-knight and partial Kropki dot
  constraints. Given: r1c1=3, r1c3=2, r2c3=4, r3c3=3, r3c4=4, r4c1=4. Kropki: White
  dot between r1c3-r1c4, Black dot between r3c1-r4c1. Make a single confident placement
  in one empty cell.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules: each digit 1-4 appears once per row/column/box.'
- Digits a knight's move apart (as in chess) must be different (Anti-Knight constraint).
- 'Kropki: A white dot indicates numbers differing by 1; a black dot indicates one
  is double the other.'
- Only the specified cells/pairs have Kropki dots; others have no dot.
- 'Initial Board: r1c1=3, r1c3=2, r2c3=4, r3c3=3, r3c4=4, r4c1=4, rest empty.'
- Make a single confident placement (i.e., deduce a digit for at least one cell using
  logic).
resources:
- Sudoku grid (size 4x4), partially filled as described.
- Anti-Knight and (partial) Kropki constraints.
- Deductive logic.
