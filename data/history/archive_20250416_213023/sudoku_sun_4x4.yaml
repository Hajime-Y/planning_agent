title: Solve a 4x4 Sudoku with Sunburn Clues
description: 'Solve the provided 4x4 Sudoku puzzle, with standard Sudoku rules (each
  digit 1-4 exactly once in each row, column, and box), and with sunburn (☀️) clues
  at r2c2, r2c4, r3c4. Sun clues mean: In any row or column with a ☀️ clue, the sun
  cell must be the SUMMIT (highest value, i.e., 4), and ALL cells in that row/col
  that are closer to the sun cell than any other sun must be lower in value. You are
  to find a cell where a specific placement is forced by these rules.'
constraints:
- 'Standard 4x4 Sudoku rules apply: no repeats of 1-4 in each row, column, and 2x2
  box.'
- '☀️ (Sun) clues at r2c2, r2c4, r3c4: Those cells must be the summit (highest, i.e.,
  4) in their row & column.'
- In rows/columns with multiple ☀️ clues, all sun cells must be assigned 4, and cells
  between them must be less than 4.
- 'Given grid is: Row 1: . 4 2 1

  Row 2: . 2 . 3

  Row 3: 2 3 1 4

  Row 4: . 1 3 .'
- 'Goal: Apply the rules (including sun clues) to deduce any cell where a placement
  is forced and identify at least one such placement.'
resources:
- Given initial Sudoku grid and sun clue positions.
- Knowledge of 4x4 Sudoku rules and sunburn clue definitions.
