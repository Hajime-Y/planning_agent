subtasks:
- id: parse_initial_board
  description: Parse the initial 4x4 sudoku board from the given string and represent
    it in a structured format.
  order: 1
  inputs:
    raw_board: '''. 1 4 . / . 3 . . / . 4 1 . / . . 3 .'''
  outputs:
    structured_board: 2D array/list representing the sudoku board (empty cells as
      0 or None).
- id: assign_friendly_status
  description: For each cell, determine if it would be 'friendly' for all possible
    digits.
  order: 2
  inputs:
    structured_board: 2D board array/list
  outputs:
    friendly_map: Mapping of each cell and possible digits to its friendly status.
- id: calculate_candidates
  description: For each empty cell, compute possible digits (candidates) satisfying
    standard sudoku constraints.
  order: 3
  inputs:
    structured_board: 2D board array/list
  outputs:
    candidates_map: Mapping of each cell to its list of possible (allowed) digits.
- id: deduce_snake_path
  description: Determine possible snake path(s) according to snake constraints and
    given 'friendly' map.
  order: 4
  inputs:
    friendly_map: Mapping from Step2
    structured_board: 2D board array/list
  outputs:
    snake_map: Set of cells that must be on the snake; possible snake structure(s).
- id: deduce_single_digit_placement
  description: Given all constraints, deduce if there is a single cell where only
    one digit can logically fit.
  order: 5
  inputs:
    structured_board: 2D board array/list
    candidates_map: from Step3
    snake_map: from Step4
  outputs:
    cell: Coordinates of the cell
    digit: Digit to place
    justification: Logical reasoning
- id: output_result
  description: 'Output the result clearly: the cell, placed digit, and logical deduction
    steps.'
  order: 6
  inputs:
    cell: from Step5
    digit: from Step5
    justification: from Step5
  outputs:
    result: Final output string or data structure.
