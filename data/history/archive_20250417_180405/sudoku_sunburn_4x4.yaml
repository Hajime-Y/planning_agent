title: 4x4 Sudoku Puzzle Solving with Sunburn Clues
description: 'Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle which is subject to standard Sudoku rules
  and includes three special ‘sunburn’ clues: r2c2, r2c4, r3c4. A sunburn clue means
  the digit at that cell indicates the number of its (orthogonally+diagonally) adjacent
  cells with a smaller digit. Initial grid is empty. Provide all forced, logical placements.'
constraints:
- Each row, column, and 2x2 box contains digits 1-4 exactly once.
- '‘Sunburn’ clues are at r2c2, r2c4, r3c4: for each, its digit equals how many adjacent
  cells have a smaller digit.'
- All remaining cells are empty (no initial clues except sunburn constraints).
- All placements must be deduced logically (no guessing).
- Provide forced placements for every empty cell if possible.
