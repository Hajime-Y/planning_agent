title: Solve 4x4 Sudoku with Snake and Friendly Constraints
description: 'Fill the given 4x4 sudoku puzzle step-by-step, always making one certain
  placement at a time. The grid is:

  . 1 4 .

  . 3 . .

  . 4 1 .

  . . 3 .

  Additional rules:

  - A cell is ''friendly'' if its digit matches its row, column, or 2x2 box number
  (rows/cols 1-indexed).

  - The ''snake'' is the set of all non-friendly cells; it forms a contiguous chain
  (no branching, nor touching itself orthogonally), begins at the top-left, and visits
  every 2x2 box at least once.'
constraints:
- Fill the board making only certain (forced/logically determined) placements in each
  step.
- Each digit 1-4 appears once in each row, column and 2x2 box.
- A cell is 'friendly' if its digit equals its row, column, or box (all 1-indexed).
- The snake (all non-friendly cells) must be a single continuous chain, no branching,
  cannot touch itself orthogonally, starts at the top-left cell, and visits every
  2x2 box at least once.
- The final answer must detail all steps, one move at a time.
