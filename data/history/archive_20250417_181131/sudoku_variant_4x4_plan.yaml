title: 4x4 Sudoku Variant Solving Plan
description: Solve a 4x4 sudoku-like puzzle with given digits and variant rules (thermometer
  constraints, white/black dots etc.; see details for full rules).
constraints:
- 'Grid size: 4x4. Cells named r{row}c{col}.'
- 'Givens: r1c2=4, r1c3=5, r1c4=6, r2c2=5, r2c4=8, r3c1=4, r3c2=8, r3c3=6, r3c4=5,
  r4c2=6, r4c3=8.'
- Each row, each column, and each 2x2 box contains unique digits (no repeats), using
  the same 4-digit subset from 1-9.
- 'Thermometer constraint: along any thermometer (see puzzle, presumed given), digits
  must strictly increase from bulb.'
- 'Black dot between r4c3 and r4c4: those cells are in a 2:1 ratio.'
- 'White dot between r1c2 and r2c2: those cells are consecutive.'
- Gray square at r2c1 must be even.
resources:
- Sudoku puzzle grid (4x4, positions r1c1...r4c4)
- List of given values/constraints; white/black dot; thermometer shapes (if any).
